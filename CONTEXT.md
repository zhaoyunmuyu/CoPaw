# Swe Agent Runtime

This context defines the domain language for Swe's agent orchestration runtime, especially how the main agent coordinates SubAgent work.

## Language

**Chat History Snapshot**:
The externally returned point-in-time representation of one Chat's persisted conversation and turn state. It is a read result, not a promise to wait for an active Answer Turn to finish.
_Avoid_: live stream, wait-for-completion read, session-file view

**Shareable Answer Turn**:
One completed selected Answer Turn within a Chat, consisting of its user question and the assistant output belonging to that turn. A shared view may contain any non-contiguous set of Shareable Answer Turns without exposing the Chat's unselected turns; active, stopping, and failed turns are not shareable.
_Avoid_: individual token, whole Chat, arbitrary message fragment

**Permanent Share Link**:
An opaque link that grants anonymous, read-only access to a fixed set of Shareable Answer Turns and neither expires based on time nor supports owner revocation.
_Avoid_: live Chat link, expiring link, full-history link

**Shared Conversation Snapshot**:
The immutable representation captured when a Permanent Share Link is created. It contains only the selected Shareable Answer Turns, applies the same hidden-context redaction as the ordinary Chat history view, and is independent of later changes to the source Chat.
_Avoid_: live projection, owner Chat clone, raw session state

**Share Selection**:
The main Chat interaction in which a user chooses at least one, and any non-contiguous set of, completed Shareable Answer Turns and creates one Permanent Share Link containing their Shared Conversation Snapshot.
_Avoid_: sidebar Chat selection, per-message export, live sharing mode

**Share Token**:
The high-entropy opaque credential embedded in a Permanent Share Link. It is the sole locator for a Shared Conversation Snapshot and does not encode or reveal Chat, session, tenant, or user identity; each generation creates an independent token even for identical selections.
_Avoid_: Chat ID in URL, session token, bearer login token

**Read-only Share View**:
The public presentation of a Shared Conversation Snapshot using the Chat renderer's structured display while suppressing every state-changing action. It may show the source Chat title and message times, but not owner or internal identity details.
_Avoid_: interactive Chat page, owner session, raw debug dump

**Share Access Record**:
The audit metadata for one Permanent Share Link, including its creator, creation time, access count, and most recent access time. It does not identify anonymous viewers or duplicate the shared conversation content.
_Avoid_: viewer identity profile, access log body copy, revocation record

**Stream Attachability**:
The condition in which an active Answer Turn still accepts an additional stream subscriber for its exact turn identity. It is distinct from a previously observed Chat History Snapshot status.
_Avoid_: historical `running` status, reconnect hint, durable completion state

**Compatible Chat API Evolution**:
The rule for externally consumed Chat APIs: established paths, request fields, response fields, status values, successful SSE framing, and documented error meanings remain valid; new recovery capability is additive and optional.
_Avoid_: breaking reconnect migration, Console-only protocol, silent contract replacement

**Atomic Chat Recovery**:
One recovery request for a Chat that either attaches to its exact active Answer Turn or yields that turn's terminal Chat History Snapshot. A natural completion between observation and recovery is a successful terminal result, not a missing Chat error.
_Avoid_: GET-then-POST reconnect, stale-running retry, completion-as-404

**Recovery Event Stream**:
The single SSE response form of an Atomic Chat Recovery. It carries either the active turn's replay and live events, or one explicit terminal Chat History Snapshot event followed by normal stream completion.
_Avoid_: JSON-or-SSE response switching, terminal recovery error, second history fetch

**Terminal Chat Snapshot Event**:
The `chat.snapshot` SSE event emitted by a Compatible Current-Recovery Mode when no active Answer Turn is selected. It contains the resolved Chat ID, selected User Question Message ID when present, and the complete terminal Chat History Snapshot, after which the stream closes normally.
_Avoid_: empty assistant placeholder, terminal 404, second client history read

**Recoverable Turn Terminal Status**:
The durable public terminal status of the Answer Turn selected by a Terminal Chat Snapshot Event: `completed`, `stopped`, `failed`, or `null` when no turn exists. It is a business result within a successful recovery response, not an HTTP recovery error.
_Avoid_: internal `cancelled` exposure, completion-only persistence, terminal transport failure

**Answer Turn Settlement Barrier**:
The per-Chat admission boundary from terminal-outcome selection until that outcome is durably persisted. Current recovery and a later user submission wait behind this barrier; recovery then sees the complete terminal snapshot and only afterward may a new Answer Turn begin.
_Avoid_: pre-persistence next turn, terminal-status race, user-visible settlement conflict

**Pending Settlement Recovery**:
The failure-closed state of an Answer Turn whose terminal snapshot has not yet been durably written. The Chat retries that same write without rerunning the model and rejects recovery and new submission with retryable service unavailability; after process restart, a persisted admitted turn with no local active turn is reconciled as `failed` before the Chat resumes.
_Avoid_: unbounded silent inconsistency, rerun-on-persist-failure, orphaned-running turn, next-turn overwrite

**Current Chat Recovery**:
The default Atomic Chat Recovery scoped by Chat ID. It selects the Chat's current active Answer Turn when one exists, otherwise its latest terminal Chat History Snapshot; the server returns the selected User Question Message ID as correlation metadata rather than requiring it as recovery input.
_Avoid_: client-known-turn-only recovery, logical-session-only recovery, client-guessed current turn

**Current Chat Recovery Linearization**:
The point at which a Current Chat Recovery selects its result, shared with Answer Turn admission through one per-Chat coordinator lock. A recovery returns one coherent selected active turn or terminal snapshot; a concurrent later submission belongs wholly before or after that selection.
_Avoid_: mixed-turn snapshot, post-selection implicit refresh, independently locked recovery and submission

**Compatible Current-Recovery Mode**:
The opt-in `reconnect_mode: "current"` behavior of the established Console Chat POST. It provides Current Chat Recovery while callers that omit the mode retain the established reconnect result and error semantics.
_Avoid_: replacement recovery endpoint, changed legacy 404, implicit protocol upgrade

**Recovery Mode Selection**:
The Console Chat POST selects Compatible Current-Recovery Mode whenever `reconnect_mode` is `"current"`, with or without legacy `reconnect: true`; a request without that mode follows its established reconnect or new-submission path.
_Avoid_: required paired flags, breaking mode migration, mode-without-reconnect rejection

**Unknown Recovery Mode Tolerance**:
Any missing, non-string, or unrecognized `reconnect_mode` is treated as absent and follows the established Console Chat POST path. Only the exact value `"current"` changes behavior.
_Avoid_: unknown-mode validation error, third-party passthrough breakage, accidental protocol activation

**Console Recovery Compatibility Fallback**:
The Console sends both the established reconnect flag and Compatible Current-Recovery Mode, then treats a reconnect 404 as one prompt Chat history refresh rather than a failed assistant response. A returned history is applied as terminal state; only a second Chat-not-found result is presented as absence.
_Avoid_: legacy-backend error bubble, repeated reconnect retries, 404-as-assistant-output

**Compatible Recovery Locator**:
The optional Chat ID and established session locator accepted by Compatible Current-Recovery Mode. A caller may continue to identify its current Chat through the existing session-shaped request format; an explicit Chat ID only narrows that resolution and is never a required migration field.
When an optional Chat ID cannot be resolved or authorized, the established session locator remains eligible to resolve the caller's own Chat.
_Avoid_: mandatory Chat-ID migration, session-locator removal, optional-ID validation failure, client-generated turn identity

**Compatible Recovery Target Resolution**:
The ordered resolution of a Compatible Recovery Locator: an authorized optional Chat ID, then an existing session-shaped value that directly identifies a Chat, then a Chat uniquely selected by logical session ID, current user, and channel. An unresolved or unauthorized optional Chat ID does not prevent session resolution; the final resolved Chat is always ownership-authorized before recovery.
_Avoid_: mandatory locator precedence, session-only cross-user lookup, locator ambiguity, authorization-after-attach

**Recovery Target Concealment**:
The compatible recovery response rule that a missing Chat, an unresolvable locator, and an unauthorized resolved Chat are indistinguishable as `404 Chat not found`. Recovery never attaches or reveals turn state before Chat ownership authorization succeeds.
_Avoid_: cross-user Chat oracle, attach-before-authorize, unauthorized-state disclosure

**Non-blocking Chat History Read**:
The established Chat detail read returns the latest durably committed Chat History Snapshot immediately, including `running` when an Answer Turn remains active. It does not wait for the turn or claim to contain uncommitted live stream output.
_Avoid_: completion-waiting GET, live-token history read, stream replacement

**Tenant Bootstrap**:
The creation or repair of one tenant scope's minimum runnable directory state, including its default Agent Profile and required workspace assets. A Tenant Bootstrap completes only when that scope can load its Default Agent Profile.
_Avoid_: directory creation, partial initialization, workspace startup

**Tenant Bootstrap Recovery**:
The repair of an incomplete or unusable Tenant Bootstrap into its minimum runnable state. Its temporary rollback backup is removed immediately after successful recovery and retained when recovery fails; it is distinct from a first Tenant Bootstrap because it begins with an existing tenant scope.
_Avoid_: silent reset, tenant recreation, best-effort startup

**Tenant Bootstrap Lock**:
The cross-instance exclusive ownership of one Tenant Bootstrap, keyed by that tenant scope's effective storage identity. It prevents two application instances from initializing or recovering the same tenant scope concurrently and rejects bootstrap when this lock cannot be used.
_Avoid_: process-local bootstrap lock, logical-tenant lock, global initialization lock

**Tenant Bootstrap Readiness**:
The verified condition that a tenant scope's required configuration and Default Agent Profile assets are individually valid and mutually consistent. A ready-marker file may describe this condition but cannot establish it by itself.
_Avoid_: file-exists check, marker-only readiness, directory-present check

**Tenant Staging Artifact**:
A temporary file created within a tenant scope before an atomic replacement of its intended target. It is not tenant workspace content and must not be considered a configuration or an agent asset; artifacts left by abrupt process termination require explicit recovery or manual removal.
_Avoid_: workspace file, configuration file, recoverable user document

**Source Template**:
The explicitly provisioned and ready `default_<source_id>` tenant-scope asset used as the initialization source for tenants entering through one source system. A Source Template is distinct from both the global `default` template and an ordinary tenant scope.
_Avoid_: source tenant, default tenant, per-request configuration

**Source Template Provisioning**:
The privileged internal or CLI operation that creates or repairs a Source Template before tenant requests may consume it. It never force-overwrites a ready Source Template, fails without creating a partial template when the global default template is not ready, and ordinary tenant requests cannot initiate it.
_Avoid_: lazy template creation, tenant self-service initialization, request-time template repair

**SubAgent Definition**:
A named, versioned worker profile that describes what kind of delegated work a SubAgent can perform. One **SubAgent Definition** can be used by many **SubAgent Runs**.
_Avoid_: custom subagent, subagent template, agent config

**Run-scoped SubAgent Definition**:
A temporary **SubAgent Definition** supplied by the Main Agent for one **SubAgent Run**. It is validated like other SubAgent Definitions but is not stored for reuse, versioned as a reusable profile, or visible as a long-lived registry entry.
_Avoid_: persistent custom subagent, saved worker profile

**SubAgent Definition Source**:
The audit and launch-snapshot origin of a **SubAgent Definition**. Its values are `builtin`, `agent_owned`, `skill_owned`, and `run_scoped`; they distinguish lifecycle ownership without changing exact-name selection.
_Avoid_: generic stored source, user source, customized source

**Stored SubAgent Definition**:
A reusable **SubAgent Definition** available through the definition registry across more than one **SubAgent Run**. Stored definitions may be built-in or user-owned, but user-owned persistence and CRUD are separate from run-scoped delegation.
_Avoid_: temporary subagent, inline worker profile

**Built-in SubAgent Definition**:
A fixed reusable **Stored SubAgent Definition** supplied by the application. It remains available independently of the expert configuration center and cannot be created, edited, enabled, disabled, or deleted there.
_Avoid_: Agent-owned Definition, Skill-owned Definition, configurable default expert

**Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**:
A reusable **Stored SubAgent Definition** configured in one Agent Profile's expert catalog. It is available only to that Agent Profile while enabled and is independent of any Skill lifecycle.
_Avoid_: Skill subagent, tenant-shared definition, temporary subagent

**Agent-owned Definition Package**:
One `agents/<definition-id>.toml` file in an Agent Profile's workspace expert catalog. Its stable filename-derived **Agent-owned Definition ID** is independent of the editable unqualified `name`; it declares one **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition** and is not packaged, distributed, or enabled as a Skill.
_Avoid_: Skill-owned Definition Package, definition-store JSON record, tenant-shared configuration

**Agent-owned Definition ID**:
The stable opaque identifier represented by an Agent-owned Definition Package's filename. It is used for management, optimistic concurrency, and audit linkage; the Main Agent selects the Definition by its editable `name`, never by this ID.
_Avoid_: runtime SubAgent Name, filename-derived display name, mutable name alias

**Agent-owned SubAgent Name**:
The unqualified, Agent-unique `name` of an **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**. It cannot use a Skill qualifier or shadow a built-in Definition, while a Skill-owned Definition may share its local name through its distinct **Skill-qualified SubAgent Name**.
_Avoid_: Skill-qualified name, filename-derived fallback, built-in override

**Agent-owned Definition Lifecycle**:
The separate creation, enablement, disablement, and deletion states of an **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**. Creation produces a disabled Definition; only an enabled Definition is loaded for a later Main Agent turn, and changing the catalog does not interrupt an already launched SubAgent Run.
_Avoid_: file-exists-is-enabled, hot-reload lifecycle, run cancellation

**Skill-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**:
A reusable **SubAgent Definition** packaged by one Skill and available for new **SubAgent Runs** only while its owning Skill is enabled in the target Agent's **Query Skill Snapshot**. Disabling or deleting that Skill prevents new runs without interrupting runs that already captured the definition and snapshot; updates apply to subsequent Main Agent runs.
_Avoid_: skill subagent, independent skill agent, user-owned stored definition

**Skill-owned Definition Package**:
The `agents/<agent-name>.toml` file within a Skill package that declares one **Skill-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**. The package is distributed, scanned, and versioned together with its owning Skill.
_Avoid_: inline SKILL.md agent, shared definition-store record, agent directory manifest

**Declared SubAgent Dependency Set**:
The explicit Skill dependency names, plus an optional MCP restriction, in a **Skill-owned Definition Package**. Skills are the sole optional Skill capabilities eligible to load; when `mcps` is present, it is the sole MCP capability set eligible to load. The owning Skill controls the Definition lifecycle but is not implicitly added as a worker capability.
_Avoid_: implicit owning-skill injection, inherited workspace skills, implicit Skill discovery

**Declared SubAgent Skill Capability**:
One available Skill in an **Effective SubAgent Dependency Set** that the worker registers through the ordinary Skill Toolkit path, including that Skill's normal prompt and Skill-tool registration behavior. A Definition instruction does not inline the Skill document.
_Avoid_: embedded SKILL.md body, bypassed Skill Toolkit registration, all-workspace Skill tools

**Effective SubAgent Dependency Set**:
The available and authorized dependency subset for one **SubAgent Run**. Skills resolve only from declared names in the parent Agent's **Query Skill Snapshot**; MCPs resolve from declared names when `mcps` is present, including an empty list that disables all MCPs, otherwise from the parent Agent's enabled MCP client set. Unavailable entries are silently omitted rather than blocking the run.
_Avoid_: cross-agent dependency lookup, failed dependency resolution, all-or-nothing dependency loading, inherited workspace Skills

**Declared MCP Client Capability**:
One MCP client named by a present `mcps` field in a **Skill-owned Definition Package**, whose complete exposed tool surface is eligible for the SubAgent Run. The launch snapshot captures the parent Agent's configured client settings; the SubAgent Worker connects it independently and silently omits it when connection fails. Every MCP tool call remains subject to the parent Agent's active Tool Guard, approval, and tenant configuration; a Definition cannot bypass them.
_Avoid_: parent-client reuse, unguarded MCP access, Definition-owned approval bypass, MCP tool allowlist

**Inherited Built-in Tool Set**:
The parent Agent's currently enabled built-in tools, used as the default candidate set for every SubAgent. A Skill-owned SubAgent may narrow that set through TOML `[tools].allow` and `[tools].deny`; a Run-scoped SubAgent inherits it without a Definition-level tool override. The effective set remains bounded by SubAgent policy and Tool Guard/approval controls.
_Avoid_: unrestricted child tools, Tool Guard bypass, inherited Skill Toolkit tools

**Inherited MCP Client Set**:
The parent Agent's enabled MCP client set used by a Run-scoped SubAgent and by a Skill-owned SubAgent whose Definition Package omits `mcps`. A present `mcps` field replaces this default with its named subset; `mcps = []` explicitly disables all MCPs. An MCP client always connects from the immutable launch snapshot.
_Avoid_: live parent-client reuse, inherited workspace Skills, mutable MCP configuration

**Background SubAgent Approval Outcome**:
The result when a Background SubAgent tool call requires human approval: the Tool Guard rejects the call and returns that rejection to the worker. A Background SubAgent Run neither starts an interactive approval request nor waits for a later human decision; only already preapproved or automatically allowed operations execute.
_Avoid_: background approval dialog, paused-for-approval worker, approval bypass

**Agent-owned Definition Selection**:
The Main Agent's explicit selection of an enabled **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition** from the directory exposed by `start_subagent`. It chooses by the Definition's description and trigger keywords, then calls the exact unqualified name; the runtime does not automatically route to it.
_Avoid_: automatic matching, description short-circuit, implicit expert launch

**Skill-owned Definition Selection**:
The Main Agent's choice of a **Skill-owned Stored SubAgent Definition** by comparing the Definition's `description` and declared trigger keywords with the delegated need, then starting it by exact `name`. It does not accept caller-supplied role instructions.
_Avoid_: task-type labels, caller-authored subagent instruction, automatic delegation

**Explicit SubAgent Intent Gate**:
The requirement that the current user message explicitly mentions a SubAgent before the Main Agent receives Background SubAgent tools. Available **Skill-owned Stored SubAgent Definitions** do not independently expose delegation tools or cause automatic delegation.
_Avoid_: definition-driven tool exposure, implicit background work, autonomous delegation

**Main-Agent-only Delegation**:
The rule that Background SubAgent tools are never registered for a SubAgent, including a Skill-owned SubAgent with loaded Skills, MCPs, or mutable built-in tools. Only the Main Agent may create a further SubAgent Run.
_Avoid_: nested delegation, recursive worker tree, SubAgent orchestration

**Skill-owned Definition Trigger Keywords**:
The explicit `trigger_keywords` in a **Skill-owned Definition Package** that help the Main Agent select its Definition for a delegated need. They supplement its `description`; they are not a separate automatic execution mechanism.
_Avoid_: task-type labels, implicit NLP classification, automatic delegation

**Skill-owned Model Reference**:
The optional `[model]` provider-and-identifier pair in a **Skill-owned Definition Package**. It may select only a model already configured for the tenant and available to the Main Agent; when unavailable, the SubAgent silently inherits the Main Agent model and the package cannot contain provider connection or credential settings.
_Avoid_: model-id-only reference, provider configuration, API key, arbitrary model endpoint, failed run for unavailable model

**Skill-owned Model Selection**:
The use of a resolved **Skill-owned Model Reference** by a Skill-owned SubAgent Worker. Any cloud or local model is eligible when the current tenant configuration resolves its provider-and-identifier pair; built-in and Run-scoped SubAgent Definitions inherit the parent model.
_Avoid_: cloud-only model selection, model switching for built-in definitions, model routing in a run-scoped definition

**Agent-owned Model Reference**:
The optional provider-and-identifier pair in an Agent-owned Definition Package. It names a model already configured for the tenant and cannot carry provider connection or credential settings.
_Avoid_: model-id-only reference, provider configuration, API key, arbitrary model endpoint

**Agent-owned Model Selection**:
The use of a resolved **Agent-owned Model Reference** by an Agent-owned SubAgent Worker. When the referenced provider or model is unavailable, the worker silently inherits the parent Agent model.
_Avoid_: forced model availability, credential transfer, model switching for built-in definitions, model routing in a run-scoped definition

**Expert Model Picker**:
The My Experts form control that lists the current tenant's usable chat models as provider-and-model choices plus an inherit-current-chat-model option. An existing unavailable configured reference remains visible and preserved instead of being discarded.
_Avoid_: provider setup form, hidden unavailable model reset, global model picker

**Community Expert Package**:
A reusable expert shared through the Expert Community. It carries the expert's portable behavior and capability declarations, while the installing Agent Profile owns its local enablement and dependency resolution.
_Avoid_: tenant-global expert configuration, live shared expert, copied Agent Profile

**Portable Model Reference**:
The provider-and-model identifier carried by a Community Expert Package without provider connection settings or credentials. An installing Agent Profile resolves it against its own tenant configuration and falls back to its Main Agent model when unavailable.
_Avoid_: exported API key, shared provider configuration, credential-bearing expert package

**Expert Community Scope**:
The source-scoped community boundary for Community Expert Packages. It is a dedicated top-level Console destination immediately after Application Marketplace, rather than an Application Marketplace resource page; users browse and receive experts within their source and assigned institution visibility, while source administrators own publication, update, withdrawal, and distribution actions.
_Avoid_: global expert marketplace, institution-bypassing expert catalog, Application Marketplace expert tab, Creation Center submenu, tenant-global expert catalog, author-managed market publication

**Expert Community Administrator**:
The existing Marketplace manager authorized to publish, maintain versions, unpublish, withdraw, and distribute Community Expert Packages under the established Skills and MCPs manager convention. Ordinary users may browse, install, and locally manage received experts but cannot mutate community items.
_Avoid_: expert-specific role, author-only publisher, ordinary-user market editor

**Community Expert Source**:
The Agent-owned expert definition maintained in its author's Agent Profile and used as the input for explicit community synchronization. The market copy is not edited directly; later source edits produce a new market version.
_Avoid_: market-owned expert definition, live shared definition, automatic bidirectional sync

**Community Expert Installation**:
The creation of a new Agent-owned Definition Package from a Community Expert Package. User-initiated installation targets the currently selected Agent Profile, while administrator distribution targets each recipient's Default Agent Profile; the receiving package has its own management identity. Installation identity is scoped by user, Agent Profile, and community item ID, so a user may independently install the same package in different Agent Profiles. A package already installed in one target Agent Profile cannot be reinstalled or self-updated by its user.
_Avoid_: shared Definition ID, user-global installation, repeat-install overwrite, recipient self-update, publisher workspace copy, tenant-wide expert activation

**Received Community Expert**:
An Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition created by installing or receiving a Community Expert Package. It records its community item, received version, and local content identity; it follows the receiving Agent Profile's lifecycle and can be edited or removed locally without changing the community source.
_Avoid_: live marketplace binding, immutable market definition, source expert alias

**Community Expert Administrator Distribution**:
The only community-driven update path for a Received Community Expert. A source administrator distributes a newer Community Expert Package to recipients' Default Agent Profiles; recipients do not pull updates from the community themselves, and distribution silently replaces any local received-expert modifications.
_Avoid_: recipient-driven marketplace update, automatic update, local-edit conflict, live version tracking

**Received Community Expert Enablement**:
The enablement rule for a Received Community Expert: a first user installation or administrator distribution enables it, while an administrator update preserves the receiving Agent Profile's existing enabled or disabled choice.
_Avoid_: always-disabled community install, update-forces-enable, publish-state inheritance

**Community Expert Variant**:
A locally edited Received Community Expert whose frozen bundled Skill and MCP content remains read-only. It remains local and cannot be synchronized to the Expert Community, including by an Expert Community Administrator. To change dependencies or share a variant, its owner separately creates a new local Community Expert Source and binds the owner's own resources; no received-expert copy action is provided. It never overwrites or synchronizes back to the original community item.
_Avoid_: bundled-dependency editor, received-expert copy action, received-expert publication, ordinary-user publication, reverse synchronization, forkless community update, publisher-definition mutation

**Community Expert Name**:
The source-scoped unique display name of a Community Expert Package. A same-name publication requires explicit administrator confirmation, then continues the existing community item as a new version while preserving its version history.
_Avoid_: duplicate source expert listing, silent cross-author replacement, unversioned overwrite

**Community Expert Category**:
The optional source-managed category assigned to a Community Expert Package for Expert Community browsing and filtering. It does not become part of the receiving local expert or affect execution.
_Avoid_: runtime expert category, Agent Profile category, locally persisted community taxonomy

**Community Expert Version Snapshot**:
The immutable expert definition, frozen private Skill and MCP dependency copies, and Skill publication-scan result captured for one Community Expert version. The first version is `1.0.0`; changed republishing advances its patch version, while identical content creates no version.
_Avoid_: mutable expert version, independently versioned bundled dependency, duplicate no-op version

**Community Expert Version Restoration**:
The administrator action that makes a historical Community Expert Version Snapshot the current community version. Later distribution uses that restored snapshot.
_Avoid_: recipient-local rollback, untracked historical copy, partial dependency rollback

**Complete Community Expert Publication**:
The publishability condition that every Skill and MCP declared by a Community Expert Source is present and readable in its publishing Agent Profile so the version can freeze a complete private dependency copy. A missing or unreadable declared dependency blocks that publication without changing an older community version.
_Avoid_: partial expert version, declaration-only dependency publishing, best-effort dependency omission

**Expert Dependency Integrity Failure**:
The pre-launch failure when a Selected Expert's frozen private Skill or MCP package is missing, unreadable, or structurally invalid. The expert does not start and the user is directed to restore the received package through administrator distribution or re-receiving.
_Avoid_: partial run from corrupted package, silent missing private dependency, fallback to general Agent dependencies

**Expert MCP Connectivity Degradation**:
The non-fatal condition in which a structurally valid frozen Expert MCP configuration cannot connect to its external service. The Selected Expert still runs without that MCP and the current conversation reports the reduced capability.
_Avoid_: corrupted-package failure, whole-expert failure for transient MCP outage, hidden MCP omission

**Community Expert Installation Name Conflict**:
The attempted first installation of a Community Expert whose runtime SubAgent Name already belongs to an unrelated local expert in the target Agent Profile. It is rejected without changing either expert; only a later administrator update of the same community item may replace its received copy.
_Avoid_: first-install overwrite, automatic runtime-name suffix, unrelated local expert replacement

**Community Expert Distribution Conflict**:
The per-user failure in a batch Community Expert distribution when that user's Default Agent Profile has an unrelated enabled expert with the package's runtime SubAgent Name. The conflicting user is skipped without changing either expert, while distribution proceeds for every other target user.
_Avoid_: batch-wide abort, unrelated-expert overwrite, automatic name suffix

**Community Expert Withdrawal**:
The explicit administrator operation that removes a Community Expert's received copies, identified by community item ID, from selected users or from every user when no target is specified, regardless of whether each copy arrived by distribution or user installation. In-progress runs finish, but completed withdrawal immediately prevents later selection or invocation in every Chat and releases its session dependency view. It is distinct from unpublishing, which only stops new browsing, installation, and distribution while existing copies remain usable.
_Avoid_: in-flight run termination, unpublish-means-delete, name-based recall, distribution-only withdrawal, automatic removal on withdrawal from market

**Session-scoped Expert Dependency View**:
The temporary Skill and MCP availability granted to one Chat session from a Community Expert Package's frozen private dependency copy. It contains only the expert's declared dependencies, never writes those dependencies to the receiving Agent Profile, and never makes other Agent Profile Skill or MCP resources visible to that expert or to another Chat session.
_Avoid_: persistent dependency installation, Agent Profile resource passthrough, tenant-wide expert dependency, cross-session capability grant

**Temporary Expert Dependency Binding**:
The session-lifetime association between a Community Expert and its frozen private Skill and MCP dependency copy. Declared dependency names always resolve to that private copy rather than an Agent Profile resource of the same name; MCP configuration is copied with the package under the same full-configuration semantics as Marketplace MCP distribution, and each resource remains subject to runtime availability, Tool Guard, and approval checks.
_Avoid_: same-name Agent resource fallback, live market lookup, permanent Skill or MCP enablement, Agent-wide dependency registration

**Frozen Expert MCP Configuration**:
The complete MCP configuration copied into a Community Expert Package version and then into its received expert's private dependency directory. It follows the existing Marketplace MCP publication and distribution contract, including `headers` and `env`, and is usable only through the expert's session-scoped dependency view.
_Avoid_: redacted expert dependency copy, general Agent MCP registration, per-session market re-resolution

**Expert Private Dependency Directory**:
The Definition-ID-bound companion directory `agents/<definition-id>.dependencies/`, containing frozen `skills/` and `mcp/` copies for one Community Expert. It coexists with, and does not replace, the expert's `agents/<definition-id>.toml` Definition Package.
_Avoid_: shared workspace dependency directory, Agent-wide Skill/MCP directory, Definition Package migration

**Expert Dependency Session Initialization**:
The one-time initialization of a Chat's Session-scoped Expert Dependency View when the user first selects or invokes a Community Expert. The resulting frozen dependency view remains available through later turns of that Chat and is released when the Chat ends.
_Avoid_: per-turn dependency loading, Agent Profile installation, cross-chat dependency reuse

**Explicit Expert Selection**:
The per-message user action in the Chat composer's Expert control, displayed alongside the Model control, that selects one enabled Agent-owned or Received Community Expert. The selection clears after submission; without it, no expert directory or Background SubAgent tool is exposed to the Main Agent.
_Avoid_: mode control, intent-keyword delegation, implicit expert discovery, Main-Agent-selected expert, session-persistent expert selection

**Composer Expert Catalog**:
The searchable list of valid enabled local and Received Community Experts in the currently selected Agent Profile, shown by the Chat composer's Expert control. Community listings are not directly callable; an expert must first be received by that Agent Profile.
_Avoid_: global expert chooser, direct community invocation, disabled expert catalog, cross-Agent expert list

**Selected Expert Execution**:
The direct start of the single Expert named by an Explicit Expert Selection for that submitted message. The Main Agent may hand off the objective and summarize the result but cannot skip, substitute, or select another expert.
_Avoid_: optional selected-expert use, multiple expert fan-out, Main Agent routing decision

**Selected Expert Model Resolution**:
The model precedence for a Selected Expert Execution: a usable configured expert model is used first; otherwise the Chat's currently selected model is used as the expert fallback. The Chat model remains available for Main Agent summarization.
_Avoid_: disabled Chat model control, forced unavailable expert model, implicit model switch

**Expert and Plan Mode Exclusivity**:
The composer interaction rule that Explicit Expert Selection and Plan Mode cannot coexist. Selecting an Expert clears Plan Mode; enabling Plan Mode clears the Expert selection, while both controls remain available for an explicit user switch.
_Avoid_: disabled mode switch, hidden expert clearing, expert-assisted Plan Mode, conflicting execution modes

**Synchronous Expert Conversation**:
The Chat interaction in which a Selected Expert Execution displays progress and cancellation while the current message awaits the SubAgent Run, then automatically presents the Main Agent's summary in that same conversation turn. Failures, timeouts, and cancellation are likewise reported in the current turn while the underlying SubAgent Run remains observable.
_Avoid_: result-polling follow-up, detached-only expert run, hidden failure state

**Expert Dependency Publication Scan**:
The one-time mandatory safety scan of each Skill copied into a new Community Expert Package version. Receiving or using that unchanged frozen version does not re-run the scan.
_Avoid_: target-side policy scan, per-session safety scan, unscanned expert dependency publication

**Skill-owned Delegation Prompt**:
The layered SubAgent prompt constructed from its Definition `instruction`, fixed runtime safety rules, the delegated `objective`, and optional `background`. The Definition instruction and safety rules are trusted system instructions; `background` is delimited as untrusted task material in that system message, while `objective` is structured user input. Neither task field can replace the Definition's role instruction.
_Avoid_: instruction argument, parent transcript, inherited main-agent prompt

**Skill-qualified SubAgent Name**:
The registry-visible name formed by the runtime as `<skill-name>:<local-name>` for a Definition declared in a **Skill-owned Definition Package**. The Main Agent selects and calls this qualified name; the TOML author supplies only the local name.
_Avoid_: globally unique local name, implicit alternative identifier, display nickname

**Invalid Skill-owned Definition Package**:
An `agents/<agent-name>.toml` file that cannot be parsed or validated as a safe **Skill-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**. It is omitted while its owning Skill and sibling Definition Packages remain available, and it does not alter the Skill package's ordinary security scan.
_Avoid_: whole-skill load failure, unsafe best-effort definition, skipped package scan

**Invalid Agent-owned Definition Package**:
An `agents/<definition-id>.toml` file in an Agent Profile workspace that cannot be parsed or validated as a safe **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition**. The Main Agent omits it without affecting other Definitions, while the expert configuration center reports the validation error for repair; it is distinct from a valid disabled Definition.
_Avoid_: disabled Definition, whole-agent load failure, implicit repair

**SubAgent Definition Store**:
The Agent-Profile-scoped catalog of **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definitions**, represented by their **Agent-owned Definition Packages**. It is separate from fixed built-in Definitions and from Skill-owned Definition Packages.
_Avoid_: tenant-global registry, definition-store JSON record, built-in catalog

**Definition Resolution Precedence**:
The name-reservation rule for loaded Definitions: a Skill-qualified SubAgent Name is exclusively owned by its Skill, and an inner local name is isolated by that qualification. An Agent-owned Definition cannot use a built-in name, so exact selection has one owner rather than a runtime precedence tie-breaker.
_Avoid_: name-collision priority, Agent-owned-over-skill resolution, custom builtin override, nondeterministic collision handling

**SubAgent Start Request**:
The compact Main Agent tool request for starting one **SubAgent Run**. It always includes a **SubAgent Name** and objective; its optional **Instruction** is considered only when no loaded Definition resolves by exact name, in which case it creates a **Run-scoped SubAgent Definition**. A resolved built-in, Agent-owned, or Skill-owned Definition ignores caller-supplied Instruction and uses its own.
_Avoid_: required instruction for every start, instruction override, registration payload, full definition schema

**SubAgent Definition Resolution**:
The exact-name decision to use a loaded built-in, Agent-owned, or Skill-owned Definition instead of the **Run-scoped SubAgent Definition** described by a **SubAgent Start Request**. A Definition's own instruction controls execution.
_Avoid_: instruction override, automatic matching, silent definition rewrite

**Definition Match Metadata**:
The audit data written to a **SubAgent Run** and returned by start/status tools to show which **SubAgent Definition Resolution** supplied the worker.
_Avoid_: hidden routing decision, implicit reuse

**Unknown SubAgent**:
An error condition for catalog-facing operations that require an existing reusable Definition by name. It is not part of the compact **SubAgent Start Request**, which falls back to a **Run-scoped SubAgent Definition** when no exact-name resolution occurs.
_Avoid_: start_subagent fallback failure, missing temporary worker

**Instruction**:
The role and operating instructions for a **SubAgent Definition**. It is the canonical SubAgent term across Definition Packages and runtime records, because it describes the delegated worker contract rather than a raw model-message implementation detail.
_Avoid_: system_prompt, prompt text, hidden prompt, prompt.system

**Instruction Size Limit**:
An **Instruction** must be present and non-empty after trimming. Compact start requests reject instructions larger than 8 KB so the worker contract does not become a substitute for delegated task background or source material.
_Avoid_: unlimited system prompt, embedded document payload

**SubAgent Name**:
The stable identifier field named `name`, used by the Main Agent or another runtime entry point to identify a **SubAgent Definition**. It is not the display label shown to users.
_Avoid_: agent_name, display name, nickname, frontend title

**SubAgent Nickname**:
The user-facing display label for a **SubAgent Run** or **Stored SubAgent Definition**. It may be configured by a registration request or assigned from a built-in nickname pool; compact **SubAgent Start Requests** do not accept nickname input, but their run responses may still include an assigned nickname for display.
_Avoid_: agent_name, registry key, stable identifier

**SubAgent Run**:
A single observable execution instance created when the main agent delegates work to a SubAgent Definition. A **SubAgent Run** is not a new SubAgent Definition.
_Avoid_: create subagent, custom subagent, subagent profile

**Delegation Run**:
Alias for **SubAgent Run** when emphasizing the parent-to-worker handoff rather than the worker identity.
_Avoid_: subagent creation

**Background SubAgent Run**:
A **SubAgent Run** that is started by the Main Agent and observed later through status, result retrieval, or cancellation. It is still one run of a **SubAgent Definition**, not a new definition.
_Avoid_: detached subagent, subprocess subagent

**SubAgent Launch Snapshot**:
The immutable execution input captured when a **Background SubAgent Run** starts: its resolved Definition, Effective SubAgent Dependency Set, effective MCP configurations, and selected model or inherited fallback. A running worker does not observe later Skill lifecycle, package, MCP, or model changes.
_Avoid_: live dependency lookup, mid-run skill reload, mutable worker configuration

**SubAgent Launch Diagnostics**:
The audit details of a **SubAgent Launch Snapshot**, including the resolved model and loaded or silently skipped Skill and MCP dependencies. They are visible only through detailed run inspection, while ordinary start, wait, and result projections remain compact.
_Avoid_: default parent-context diagnostics, hidden execution provenance, verbose start result

**SubAgent Research Phase**:
The portion of a **SubAgent Run** in which the worker gathers task evidence and may use its effective read-only tools. It ends before the worker produces its terminal **AgentResult**.
_Avoid_: final response, structured-output phase, unbounded agent loop

**SubAgent Research Completion**:
The normal end of a **SubAgent Research Phase**, reached when the worker replies without requesting a tool. Its evidence becomes a **Bounded SubAgent Research Record** for **SubAgent Text Finalization**; reaching the turn limit instead follows the distinct **SubAgent Turn-limit Finalization** path.
_Avoid_: implicit final tool call, budget-exhaustion normal completion, forced completion

**SubAgent Research Synthesis**:
The concise natural-language, tool-free reply emitted at **SubAgent Research Completion**. It is retained as evidence in the **Bounded SubAgent Research Record** and is not an **AgentResult**.
_Avoid_: terminal result, user-facing completion claim

**Bounded SubAgent Research Record**:
The size-limited record of SubAgent research messages, including assistant replies, tool calls, and tool results. It prioritizes the newest evidence; an oversized message is truncated to fit the remaining capacity and marked as truncated. It is the research evidence supplied to **SubAgent Text Finalization** after normal completion or a turn-limit exit.
_Avoid_: full parent conversation, unbounded transcript, raw worker memory

**SubAgent Research Turn Budget**:
The maximum number of ReAct reasoning turns available to a **SubAgent Research Phase**. It does not include the one terminal **SubAgent Text Finalization** call; both phases share the run's total time budget.
_Avoid_: total model-call budget, finalization turn limit, per-phase timeout

**Skill-owned SubAgent Budget**:
The optional `[budget]` limits in a **Skill-owned Definition Package** for research turns, tool calls, and elapsed time. Omitted values use the platform defaults; supplied values may only stay within the platform maximums and are intersected with the delegated run budget.
_Avoid_: unlimited skill budget, definition-raised platform ceiling, separate finalization budget

**SubAgent Research Phase Controller**:
The SubAgent-specific agent operation that runs the ReAct research loop and reports whether it ended normally or reached its turn limit. It prevents a turn-limit fallback summary from being mistaken for **SubAgent Research Completion**.
_Avoid_: opaque reply outcome, automatic ReAct summarization, runtime-owned protected loop

**SubAgent Turn Usage**:
The actual number of model calls made by a **SubAgent Run**. It includes each research reasoning turn and the one **SubAgent Finalization Attempt**, when one occurs; it can therefore exceed the **SubAgent Research Turn Budget** by one.
_Avoid_: research-only call count, hidden terminal-call cost, turn-budget alias

**SubAgent Text Finalization**:
The terminal, tool-free step after a **SubAgent Research Phase** that asks the model for one final summary text using the supplied research context. The runtime stores that text as the `summary` of the **SubAgent Application Result**; finalization does not gather new evidence or execute work tools.
_Avoid_: ordinary ReAct turn, tool-call loop, structured output

**SubAgent Final Summary**:
The final plain-text summary generated by **SubAgent Text Finalization**. It is the only model-authored content field in a **SubAgent Application Result**.
_Avoid_: structured payload, model-generated result envelope

**SubAgent Finalization Context**:
The bounded handoff supplied to **SubAgent Text Finalization**: the original **DelegationSpec** and a **Bounded SubAgent Research Record**. It excludes the Main Agent conversation and all worker state outside that record.
_Avoid_: full parent conversation, unbounded transcript, implicit memory access

**SubAgent Turn-limit Finalization**:
The one terminal **SubAgent Text Finalization** call made after a **SubAgent Research Phase** reaches its turn budget. It uses the same **SubAgent Finalization Context** as normal completion, but the resulting **SubAgent Application Result** remains partial.
_Avoid_: unbounded transcript replay, extra research turn, skipped terminal response

**SubAgent Turn-limit Partial Result**:
The **SubAgent Application Result** emitted when a **SubAgent Turn-limit Finalization** produces a final summary. It retains that summary while reporting `partial` and `research_turn_limit_reached`, because the research phase did not complete normally.
_Avoid_: completed after turn exhaustion, discarded research summary, runtime failure

**SubAgent Finalization Attempt**:
The single **SubAgent Text Finalization** call allowed after **SubAgent Research Completion** or through **SubAgent Turn-limit Finalization**. A failed attempt produces a **SubAgent Partial Result** and is not retried.
_Avoid_: repeated terminal calls

**SubAgent Application Result**:
The application-constructed terminal result of a **SubAgent Run**. It combines a **SubAgent Final Summary**, when available, with runtime-owned identity, lifecycle status, metrics, and errors.
_Avoid_: model-authored result envelope, raw model response, unvalidated payload

**SubAgent Result Projection**:
The stable, flat caller-facing representation of a **SubAgent Application Result** returned by the Background SubAgent tools. It exposes the terminal summary without exposing the full persisted run record.
_Avoid_: payload-only API, nested response migration, internal schema leak

**SubAgent Partial Result**:
An **AgentResult** that retains an available final summary without representing the delegated task as completed. It is produced when **SubAgent Text Finalization** fails, or when **SubAgent Turn-limit Finalization** produces a summary after research exhausted its budget.
_Avoid_: completed result with warning, discarded research, research timeout result

**Background SubAgent Concurrency Limit**:
The maximum number of **Background SubAgent Runs** that one runtime scope may have running at the same time. When the limit is reached, a new background start request is rejected as blocked rather than queued.
_Avoid_: queue size, worker pool size, soft recommendation

**Background SubAgent Run Status**:
The lifecycle state of a **Background SubAgent Run** as observed by the Main Agent: `pending`, `running`, `paused`, `completed`, `partial`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `expired`. `partial` retains usable research evidence when terminal validation cannot complete. It is separate from the `status` field inside an **AgentResult**, which describes the delegated task outcome. `expired` is reserved for future supervisor cleanup semantics and is not emitted by the first background-tool implementation.
_Avoid_: AgentResult status, tool call status, process exit code

**Background SubAgent Tools**:
The Main Agent tools for managing **Background SubAgent Runs**: `start_subagent`, `wait_subagent`, `get_subagent`, and `cancel_subagent`. They are the intended SubAgent tool surface for the next implementation stage.
_Avoid_: agent tools, generic worker tools, synchronous delegate tool

**wait_subagent Tool**:
A Main Agent tool that performs a bounded wait and returns basic run identity, status information, and terminal run results for the current tenant-and-agent scope's observable **Background SubAgent Runs**. It is not a diagnostic, routing-audit, worker-inspection, or historical run-browsing surface.
_Avoid_: list agents, background queue browser, automatic completion callback, debug inspector, routing audit

**SubAgent Run Cancellation**:
The act of cancelling the execution handle that owns a **Background SubAgent Run** and marking that run as cancelled. It does not imply recursively terminating tool-owned subprocesses unless a later execution backend explicitly supports that behavior.
_Avoid_: kill process tree, hard stop all tools

**SubAgent Run Monitor**:
A user-facing view that shows the **Background SubAgent Runs** associated with the current Main Agent conversation. It is scoped to the current conversation and is not an agent-wide operations console.
_Avoid_: global subagent dashboard, worker pool monitor, all-agent status panel

**助手**:
The chat-facing display term for one **Background SubAgent Run**. It deliberately hides the internal implementation term “SubAgent” from users without changing the run's identity, API contract, or runtime semantics.
_Avoid_: 用于 API 字段、事件名或运行时领域模型的 Assistant/SubAgent 替换

**SubAgent Run Snapshot**:
A point-in-time observable summary of the current conversation's **Background SubAgent Runs**. It is the authoritative state used by user-facing monitoring surfaces, while live stream events may only prompt refresh.
_Avoid_: stream-only state, frontend cache, tool result transcript

**SubAgent Budget Consumption**:
The observable consumption of a **Background SubAgent Run**'s time and turn budgets, shown as used against total for each dimension. It is not a task-completion percentage; the live turn value is a persisted runtime observation and the terminal value is the final **SubAgent Turn Usage**.
_Avoid_: task progress, completion percent, model confidence, estimated turn count

**Frontend SubAgent Stop Request**:
A user action from a **SubAgent Run Monitor** that asks the runtime to cancel one specific **Background SubAgent Run** directly. It is not a natural-language instruction for the Main Agent to decide whether to call a tool.
_Avoid_: chat stop message, assistant-mediated cancellation, generic task stop

**SubAgent Run Stop Eligibility**:
The rule that only an actively running **Background SubAgent Run** can expose a user stop action in the **SubAgent Run Monitor**. Terminal, pending, paused, expired, and already-cancelled runs remain visible as status records but are not clickable stop targets.
_Avoid_: remove record action, terminal cleanup button, clickable status row

**SubAgent Stop Pending State**:
The temporary user-facing state shown after a **Frontend SubAgent Stop Request** has been submitted and before the next **SubAgent Run Snapshot** confirms the run's terminal status. It disables repeated stop actions without implying the run has already been cancelled.
_Avoid_: confirmed cancellation, terminal stopped state, retry button state

**SubAgent Execution Backend**:
The runtime mechanism used to execute a **SubAgent Run**, such as an in-process task or a separate operating-system process. It is an implementation boundary and does not change the meaning of **SubAgent Run**.
_Avoid_: subagent type, agent definition source

**Main Agent**:
The user-facing agent that owns global task understanding, user interaction, mode decisions, and final responses.
_Avoid_: parent bot, orchestrator bot

**Chat Checkpoint**:
A Chat-scoped recoverable state container that identifies the current task and retains a compact index of earlier completed tasks in the same Chat. Starting an explicit new task replaces its current task; `/new` resets the Chat Checkpoint.
_Avoid_: global task state, session summary, cross-chat checkpoint

**Checkpoint Record**:
The versioned, structured source of truth for a Chat Checkpoint. A Checkpoint Record distinguishes confirmed state from unresolved work and retains references to its supporting evidence.
_Avoid_: free-form summary, model-only memory, untraceable state

**Evidence Recovery**:
The on-demand, Chat-scoped restoration of an original conversation or tool-result fragment identified by a Checkpoint Record. Exact evidence references take precedence; a bounded current-epoch lookup may otherwise narrow by text, kind, and time interval. It adds only the evidence needed for the Current Task and does not replace the checkpoint state.
_Avoid_: cross-chat history search, automatic full-history injection, summary reconstruction

**Checkpoint Update**:
The validated replacement of a Checkpoint Record from deterministic conversation facts and semantic task-state interpretation. It cannot discard evidence before the replacement record has passed validation.
_Avoid_: markdown-only rewrite, unvalidated summarization, destructive compaction

**Compaction Transaction**:
The per-Chat operation that validates and durably installs a Checkpoint Update together with its archived source history. It either exposes a recoverable checkpoint or retains enough pending state to finish safely after recovery.
_Avoid_: overwrite-in-place compaction, archive-without-state, lost concurrent event

**Checkpoint Event Journal**:
The ordered, append-only Chat-scoped record of deterministic events that occurred after the event sequence incorporated by the active Checkpoint Record. It preserves the current-state delta until a later Checkpoint Update incorporates it.
_Avoid_: second free-form summary, mutable progress list, discarded pre-compaction event

**Recent Event Delta**:
The budget-bounded model-context projection of unincorporated entries from the Checkpoint Event Journal. It supplies current deterministic facts without duplicating the original interaction or becoming another semantic summary.
_Avoid_: all event history, raw tool output duplication, per-turn resummarization

**Context Budget Stage**:
One of the ordered context-capacity states—Lightweight Governance, Active Compaction, or Emergency Degradation—that determines how a Chat Checkpoint and its online history are reduced before a model call.
_Avoid_: single hard truncation threshold, post-overflow-only compaction

**Proactive Incremental Compaction**:
The asynchronous, non-blocking preparation and validation of a bounded Chat Checkpoint update before an Active Compaction threshold is reached. Its prepared candidate is installed only when its snapshot remains valid at an Active Compaction or Emergency Degradation threshold.
_Avoid_: threshold-only bulk compaction, blocking reply-path compression, per-message full resummarization

**Precompaction Candidate**:
A validated but inactive Checkpoint Update derived from a stable Chat snapshot and its exact source-message prefix. It may be installed without another ReMe call only when its base record revision, event sequence, and source prefix remain valid.
_Avoid_: stale summary cache, immediately active checkpoint, overwrite of newer events

**Elastic Context Budget**:
The allocatable capacity remaining after permanent context and model-output safety space are protected. Checkpoint projection, recent original interaction, and recovered evidence compete within it according to the Current Task rather than occupying fixed partitions.
_Avoid_: fixed percentage partition, unused reserved context, unbounded recovery injection

**Context Epoch**:
The portion of a Chat's context history eligible for default model-context assembly after a `/new` or `/clear` boundary. Earlier epochs remain durable Chat evidence but require explicit user intent before they may be recovered.
_Avoid_: automatic pre-reset recovery, physical deletion on context reset, cross-epoch default context

**Task Transition**:
The explicit change of the Current Task within a Chat Checkpoint. It occurs only when the user introduces an independent goal after completion, explicitly starts a new task, or resets the Chat; corrective and incremental requests remain part of the Current Task.
_Avoid_: every user turn is a new task, inferred task split, destructive history reset

**Agent Profile**:
A tenant-owned runtime configuration and workspace identity for one runnable Agent. An **Agent Profile** is distinct from a **SubAgent Definition**, which is a versioned delegation worker description.
_Avoid_: agent-level config, subagent profile, worker profile

**Default Agent Profile**:
The tenant's built-in **Agent Profile** with the stable identifier `default`. It is the sole scope of the first Agent Profile Hook console release and remains available rather than being disabled or removed.
_Avoid_: selected agent, active-agent selector

**Default Agent Profile Hook Access**:
The ordinary tenant-scoped access boundary for changing Default Agent Profile Hooks and their scripts. The first release adds no separate manager or administrator role requirement.
_Avoid_: manager-only hook access, global hook administrator

**Default Agent Profile Hook Audit Record**:
A best-effort structured application-log event for a Default Agent Profile Hook or Hook Script change. It identifies the actor, time, action, affected script and digest when applicable, and a configuration-delta summary without retaining script content or runtime hook payloads; a logging failure does not prevent the action.
_Avoid_: audit database table, hook execution log, full script archive, hook payload audit

**Agent Profile Hook**:
A lifecycle-hook configuration owned by exactly one **Agent Profile**. It applies only while that Agent Profile runs, rather than across a tenant or through a reusable Skill.
_Avoid_: agent-level hook, tenant hook, skill hook

**Stop Response Replacement**:
The complete replacement text supplied by a Stop Hook for one candidate Assistant Response. A replacement-capable Stop Hook makes that candidate subject to Strict Completion Finalization, so only the approved or replacement text is retained and delivered; it is not a patch, token-stream transformation, or an instruction for the Agent to produce a later answer.
_Avoid_: output patch, stream rewrite, follow-up response, completion block

**Strict Completion Finalization**:
The delivery rule that a candidate Assistant Response subject to a replacement-capable Stop Hook is withheld until every matched Stop Hook completes. The user, session record, and downstream channel receive only the approved or replaced final text, never the original candidate.
_Avoid_: optimistic replacement, provisional final response, client-side correction

**Final Response Memory Replacement**:
The atomic substitution of the current turn's final Assistant Response in Agent memory with its approved Stop Response Replacement before completion is persisted or derived. The replacement is the sole response available to later reasoning, session restoration, tracing indexes, and response-derived features.
_Avoid_: presentation-only replacement, split conversation history, dual final response

**Original Candidate Audit Boundary**:
The retention rule for a candidate Assistant Response changed by a Stop Output Transformation Pipeline. Swe-controlled persistence retains only minimal transformation metadata in application logs and never the original candidate plaintext, while a configured external Handler or model provider remains responsible for any content it has already received.
_Avoid_: raw response audit log, audit database record, recoverable original response, external-handler data erasure

**Stop Transformation Log Record**:
A best-effort application log for one output-transformation attempt that identifies participating Handler IDs and sources, replacement occurrence, input and final lengths and SHA-256 summaries, duration, and failure or time-budget status without retaining either text. A logging failure never changes completion delivery.
_Avoid_: transformation audit store, raw response log, delivery-blocking logger

**Stop Transformation Manual Test**:
The existing single-Handler Hook manual test when applied to a Stop Output Transformer with an editable sample Assistant Response. It reports that Handler's real result without running a full pipeline, altering a live session, or delivering a response; automated tests establish pipeline behavior.
_Avoid_: live response preview, full-pipeline console simulator, persisted manual transformation

**Blocked Transformation Continuation**:
The automatic Stop follow-up rule that retains only the final text produced by the Stop Output Transformation Pipeline in Agent memory when the Stop Validation Phase blocks completion. The next Agent turn receives that transformed text and the blocking reason, never the original candidate.
_Avoid_: original-candidate retry context, raw response restoration, split blocked attempt

**Stop Transformation Failure Policy**:
The fail-closed or diagnostic-only outcome when a Stop Output Transformer times out, errors, or returns an invalid replacement. An allowing failure preserves the current text and continues the pipeline; a blocking failure ends the request incomplete without executing later handlers or starting an automatic follow-up.
_Avoid_: unsafe fallback delivery, automatic failure retry, best-effort blocking transformation

**Stop Transformation Time Budget**:
The Agent Profile-owned bounded wall-clock allowance for one Stop Output Transformation Pipeline, defaulting to thirty seconds. Each Transformer receives no more than its own timeout and the remaining pipeline budget; tenant and Skill configuration cannot raise it, and exhaustion ends the request incomplete without delivery or an automatic follow-up.
_Avoid_: Skill-raised transformation budget, tenant-raised transformation budget, unbounded serial transformation, per-handler-only timeout, retry-after-budget-exhaustion

**Stop Output Transformation Pipeline**:
The ordered phase of a Stop completion attempt that applies each matched output-transforming Handler's complete replacement to the current candidate Assistant Response. Each later transformation receives the prior transformation's result, rather than the original candidate.
_Avoid_: concurrent replacement conflict, output patch chain, Agent follow-up

**Stop Output Transformer**:
A Stop Hook Handler explicitly admitted to the Stop Output Transformation Pipeline. A command, HTTP, or prompt Handler may be a Stop Output Transformer; a Handler's technical type alone does not grant it output-replacement authority.
_Avoid_: implicitly transforming Stop Handler, prompt-only rewriter, general Stop Handler

**Stop Output Transformation Declaration**:
The explicit Handler configuration that admits one Stop Hook Handler to the Stop Output Transformation Pipeline and makes its completion attempt subject to Strict Completion Finalization. An undeclared Handler has no output-replacement authority even if it returns replacement-shaped data.
_Avoid_: inferred transformation, response-output heuristic, global Stop rewrite switch

**Potential Stop Output Transformer**:
A declared Stop Output Transformer whose event and matcher scope can apply to the current completion attempt before its text-dependent condition is evaluated. Its presence requires Text-only Strict Completion Delivery even when every later transformation condition passes through the candidate unchanged.
_Avoid_: post-stream transformation decision, condition-only buffering, leaked conditional candidate

**Output Transformation Source Order**:
The fixed precedence order for matched Stop Output Transformers: tenant-level Handlers, then Agent Profile Handlers, then Handlers from explicitly activated Skills. Multiple Skill sources run by lexical `skill_name`; a source's matcher groups and Handlers retain their declaration order. A Skill that is not activated for the current session has no output-transformation authority.
_Avoid_: activation-order transformer, unactivated Skill transformer, source-order inversion, tenant-bypassing Skill rewrite

**Valid Stop Response Replacement**:
A Stop Response Replacement whose complete text contains non-whitespace content. Its text is preserved exactly as supplied; an empty or whitespace-only value is not a response-suppression request and is invalid.
_Avoid_: empty replacement, implicit output suppression, normalized replacement text

**Stop Replacement Output Contract**:
The shared Handler result contract in which an allowing Stop Output Transformer may place one Valid Stop Response Replacement in `hookSpecificOutput.replacementText`. Command, HTTP, and prompt Handlers use the same contract; omitting it preserves the current candidate text.
_Avoid_: handler-specific replacement schema, top-level replacement field, implicit textual output

**Stop Transformation Snapshot Continuity**:
The rule that an output-transforming or validating Stop Handler that explicitly requests a Hook Conversation Snapshot receives the existing snapshot without filtering or substituting the current candidate Assistant Response. Its `assistant_response` field still carries the Handler's current pipeline text, while the snapshot may contain the original candidate under ordinary snapshot rules.
_Avoid_: transformed snapshot, candidate redaction, snapshot-payload rewriting

**Dynamic Stop Transformation Matching**:
The rule that each Stop Output Transformer's conditional eligibility is evaluated immediately before it processes the current pipeline text, while Stop Validation Phase eligibility is evaluated only after the pipeline produces its final text. Conditions therefore assess the text their Handler can actually process.
_Avoid_: original-only pipeline condition, pre-transformation validation condition, static completion plan

**Per-attempt Stop Transformation Requirement**:
The rule that a Stop Output Transformer participates in every candidate completion attempt for which it is eligible. A once-only Handler cannot be a Stop Output Transformer because it would allow a later candidate to bypass the declared transformation.
_Avoid_: once-only transformer, first-candidate-only rewrite, optional later transformation

**Text-only Stop Output Transformation**:
The first-release boundary that applies Stop Response Replacements only to an extractable final Assistant Response text. It neither changes nor suppresses media, attachments, tool cards, or other structured output, and does not start a transformation pipeline for a turn with no extractable Assistant Response text.
_Avoid_: media rewrite, attachment suppression, structured-output transformation, universal response filter

**Text-only Strict Completion Delivery**:
The delivery rule that withholds only candidate Assistant Response text while Strict Completion Finalization is active. Tool status, progress, approval, and other non-response events remain live and are not part of the output-transformation contract.
_Avoid_: whole-turn buffering, hidden tool progress, transformed progress card

**Stop Validation Phase**:
The concurrent phase of a Stop completion attempt after its Stop Output Transformation Pipeline has produced its final candidate. Its non-transforming Handlers audit or gate that final candidate without changing it.
_Avoid_: ordered validator chain, pre-transformation validation, output transform

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution**:
The explicit one-time copying of a source tenant's complete executable **Agent Profile Hook** unit to selected target tenants' Default Agent Profiles. The unit contains the Hook configuration and every referenced **Agent Profile Hook Script**; each target receives its own independent copy.
_Avoid_: shared Hook, configuration-only distribution, cross-tenant Hook ownership

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Merge**:
The target-specific application of an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution**, where a source Matcher Group replaces a target Matcher Group with the same **Agent Profile Hook Matcher Group Identifier**, including its matcher and ordered Handlers. Source-only Matcher Groups are added and target-only Matcher Groups remain unchanged.
_Avoid_: Handler-ID merge, full configuration replacement, implicit group matching

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Transaction**:
The independent all-or-nothing application of one **Agent Profile Hook Distribution** to one target tenant. Its referenced scripts, configuration merge, and activation either all complete or leave that target unchanged; outcomes for other target tenants remain independent.
_Avoid_: cross-tenant transaction, partial target update, configuration-only success

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Selection**:
One or more source **Agent Profile Hook Matcher Groups** explicitly selected for an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution**. Each selected Matcher Group and its referenced scripts form the distribution payload.
_Avoid_: single-Handler distribution, implicit full-profile distribution, event-name selection

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Source Snapshot**:
The saved configuration revision and controlled script artifacts from which an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution** is made. An unsaved Hook configuration draft cannot be a distribution source.
_Avoid_: draft distribution, live mutable source, inferred source revision

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Confirmation Freshness**:
The rule that confirming an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution** does not require its source revision or script digests to match the values observed when the distribution dialog opened. The distribution uses the latest saved source configuration and script artifacts available when it executes.
_Avoid_: confirmation snapshot lock, stale-source conflict, draft source

**Missing Agent Profile Hook Distribution Selection**:
A source validation failure where a Matcher Group selected for an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution** no longer exists when the request executes. It rejects the entire distribution before any target tenant is changed.
_Avoid_: silently skipped group, per-target missing-group result, partial source payload

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Audit Record**:
A best-effort structured application-log record for one attempt to apply an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution** to one target tenant. It identifies the actor, source and target tenants, source revision, selected Matcher Groups, script digests and transfer outcomes without retaining script content or Hook runtime payloads.
_Avoid_: batch-only audit record, script-content archive, Hook execution log

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Access**:
The source-scoped authorization boundary for initiating an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution**. An authorized caller may target only tenants in its current source scope, and may not target its own current tenant.
_Avoid_: cross-source distribution, self-distribution, manager-only Hook distribution

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Target Bootstrap**:
The initialization of a manually specified target tenant's Default Agent Profile in the current source scope before applying an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution**. The per-target result identifies whether this Bootstrap occurred during the distribution.
_Avoid_: discovered-target-only distribution, uninitialized target write, cross-source bootstrap

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Credential Boundary**:
The rule that an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution** never reads or copies values from a tenant runtime environment or secret store. It copies selected Hook configuration verbatim, including literal command environment and HTTP header values, while each target resolves configuration references against its own runtime values.
_Avoid_: runtime-secret distribution, shared tenant credential, target-secret preflight

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Script Conflict**:
A target-specific conflict where a selected source script has the same name but different content from a script referenced by a target Matcher Group retained outside the distribution. The target distribution fails unless the scripts have the same digest or every target reference belongs to a Matcher Group replaced by the distribution.
_Avoid_: silent script replacement, automatic script renaming, retained-group mutation

**Agent Profile Hook Distribution Script Transfer**:
The copying of selected source **Agent Profile Hook Scripts** into a target's controlled script library as part of an **Agent Profile Hook Distribution**. It preserves the source script artifact without running a target-side script safety scan.
_Avoid_: target-side scan, unverified arbitrary-file copy, script upload

**Agent Profile Hook Handler**:
One configured action within an **Agent Profile Hook**. It is either a command handler, an HTTP handler, or a prompt handler; only a command handler may reference one or more **Agent Profile Hook Scripts**.
_Avoid_: shell hook, script hook configuration

**Agent Profile Hook Script**:
A Python or shell executable asset owned by one **Agent Profile** and referenced through a command handler's ordered arguments. One command handler may reference multiple Agent Profile Hook Scripts; scripts cannot be deleted, but a same-name upload replaces the stored content after an explicit warning.
_Avoid_: shared hook script, skill hook script, arbitrary binary, disposable script

**Agent Profile Hook Script Replacement**:
The explicit same-name upload that replaces an Agent Profile Hook Script's content for later Hook events. It records both the prior and replacement script digests and does not interrupt an executing Hook.
_Avoid_: silent overwrite, script deletion

**Agent Profile Hook Script Path Boundary**:
The rule that a command handler may reference executable programs and ordinary arguments freely, but every argument used as a script must resolve to an Agent Profile Hook Script owned by the Default Agent Profile. Paths outside that controlled script set are not script references.
_Avoid_: workspace script reference, absolute script path, path escape

**Agent Profile Hook Script Type Boundary**:
The first-release upload policy accepts only Python and shell source files with `.py`, `.sh`, `.bash`, or `.zsh` names. It excludes extensionless files and binary assets.
_Avoid_: extensionless script, binary hook asset

**Agent Profile Hook Script Safety Scan**:
The application security scan applied to every Agent Profile Hook Script upload or replacement. It follows the active scan policy: disabled, warning-only, or blocking for unsafe findings.
_Avoid_: unconditional script rejection, unscanned replacement

**Agent Profile Hook Script Upload Batch**:
One or more Hook Script files submitted together to the script library. Each file is validated and scanned independently, so successful files are retained while failed files report their own reasons.
_Avoid_: all-or-nothing script upload, silent partial upload

**Agent Profile Hook Script Upload Limit**:
The first-release storage boundary of at most 1 MB per Hook Script and at most 20 files per Upload Batch.
_Avoid_: unrestricted script upload, general file storage

**Agent Profile Hook Activation Boundary**:
The point after a saved Agent Profile Hook configuration has reloaded, from which later Hook events use it. A Hook already executing continues with its prior configuration and scripts.
_Avoid_: immediate interruption, retroactive Hook update

**Agent Profile Hook Configuration Removal**:
The saved removal of a Handler or Matcher Group from the Default Agent Profile Hook configuration. It stops later Hook events from resolving that configuration while leaving its Hook Scripts retained in the script library.
_Avoid_: script deletion, immediate Hook interruption

**Agent Profile Hook Configuration Revision**:
The version token for the complete Default Agent Profile Hook configuration. A save must name the revision it was based on; a mismatched current revision is a conflict rather than a silent overwrite.
_Avoid_: last-writer-wins configuration save, invisible concurrent overwrite

**Agent Profile Hook Manual Test**:
An explicitly confirmed execution of one draft Agent Profile Hook Handler with an editable sample context. It does not save configuration, activate a reload, or consume once-only state; it performs the handler's real external effects, and its result is audited and presented in a redacted, bounded form.
_Avoid_: full Hook replay, production event replay, unsandboxed preview

**Agent Profile Hook Console**:
The Default Agent Profile's user interface for maintaining its Hooks, Handlers, Scripts, and manual tests. It is a dedicated Run Center page with configuration and script-library areas; its changes emit audit logs, which are viewed through the application log system rather than the console.
_Avoid_: raw configuration editor, partial Hook form

**Agent Profile Hook Handler Identifier**:
The stable identifier of one Agent Profile Hook Handler. It is generated by the console by default, may be edited, and must be unique across the Default Agent Profile Hook configuration.
_Avoid_: duplicate handler ID, display-only handler name

**Agent Profile Hook Matcher Group Identifier**:
The stable identifier of one Agent Profile Hook Matcher Group. It is generated by the console by default, may be edited, and must be unique across the Default Agent Profile Hook configuration.
_Avoid_: duplicate group ID, event-local-only group ID

**Plan Mode**:
A user-visible planning state where the Main Agent itself runs under reduced planning permissions and interacts with the user through planning cards before execution continues.
_Avoid_: dry run, planning prompt

**Proposed Plan**:
A planning artifact presented by the Main Agent for user review before continuing work. A Proposed Plan contains a plan id, title, summary, steps, risks, and verification items.
_Avoid_: permission request, execution unlock

**Plan Review Decision**:
The user's response to a Proposed Plan: `revise`, `execute`, or `exit_plan`. `revise` enters or keeps Plan Mode active for replanning, `execute` accepts the persisted Proposed Plan and continues in normal mode, and `exit_plan` closes Plan Mode without starting a Main Agent execution run by default.
_Avoid_: tool approval, permission grant

**Plan Interaction Card**:
A structured chat UI card used by the Main Agent to ask for planning clarification or present a Proposed Plan. A Plan Interaction Card is user-facing and is not emitted directly by a SubAgent.
_Avoid_: subagent question card, free-form prompt hack

**Plan Interaction Composer Replacement**:
A blocking chat composer state where one active Plan Interaction Card replaces the normal user input panel until the user completes or dismisses that card. It owns the visible input controls for that moment; the normal composer input, send action, attachments, quick menu, and Plan Mode prefix controls are not concurrently available.
_Avoid_: card above composer, floating plan card, parallel input form

**Active Plan Interaction Card**:
The latest non-superseded Plan Interaction Card in the chat timeline that is currently waiting for user action. At most one Active Plan Interaction Card owns the Plan Interaction Composer Replacement at a time.
_Avoid_: all pending cards, card type priority, parallel active cards

**Planning Clarification Card**:
A Plan Interaction Card that asks the user for missing planning information using single choice, multiple choice, or text input.
_Avoid_: generic form, survey

**Custom Clarification Response**:
A user-authored text answer shown as an always-visible input on a top-level single-choice or multiple-choice Planning Clarification Card. For single choice it is mutually exclusive with selecting a listed option; for multiple choice it may be submitted together with listed options. It is not a field-level option inside a structured clarification form.
_Avoid_: collapsed other option, form field other option, generated option, hidden option id

**Plan Interaction Response**:
The user's structured answer to a Plan Interaction Card, submitted as the next normal chat turn with metadata that identifies the card and selected or entered value.
_Avoid_: hidden plan API update, out-of-band form submission

**Plan Interaction Event**:
A persisted chat-context event that records a user's submitted action on a Plan Interaction Card, such as answering a clarification or deciding on a Proposed Plan. It is metadata, not user-visible prose, and it identifies the card by stable source identity first with runtime instance identity only as a fallback.
_Avoid_: browser cache flag, local UI state, hidden text command

**Plan Review Submission**:
A Plan Interaction Event that records the user's `revise`, `execute`, or `exit_plan` decision for a Proposed Plan. Restored Plan Review Cards use this event and any backend-submitted status as the sources of truth for whether the review has already been handled.
_Avoid_: browser-submitted flag, frontend-only review state

**Plan Revision Input**:
The next user-authored chat turn after the user chooses to continue modifying a Proposed Plan. It is the content submitted with a `revise` Plan Review Decision and keeps Plan Mode active.
_Avoid_: empty revise click, implicit plan rejection

**Plan Mode Exit Feedback**:
The user-visible confirmation that an `exit_plan` Plan Review Decision succeeded. It is expressed by the Plan Mode control leaving the composer area, not by adding a chat message or starting a Main Agent run.
_Avoid_: assistant exit message, plan execution result

**Plan Review Snapshot**:
A read-only historical presentation of a Proposed Plan after it has appeared in the chat history. A **Plan Review Snapshot** preserves review context but is not the active place for submitting a Plan Review Decision.
_Avoid_: stale actionable card, replayed plan approval

**Accepted Plan Review Snapshot**:
A Plan Review Snapshot for a Proposed Plan whose `execute` Plan Review Decision has been submitted. It shows that the plan was accepted and normal Main Agent execution has started or will start.
_Avoid_: active execution approval, editable accepted plan

**Revised Plan Review Snapshot**:
A Plan Review Snapshot for a Proposed Plan whose `revise` Plan Review Decision has been submitted. It shows that the previous proposal was sent back for modification and may include the user's Plan Revision Input as review context.
_Avoid_: active revision form, rejected plan

**Planning Clarification Dismissal**:
The user's decision to close the current Planning Clarification Card without submitting a Plan Interaction Response. It is a current-runtime UI action, leaves Plan Mode active, and restores normal chat input for the user; after session restore it is not remembered unless the clarification was superseded by a later user message.
_Avoid_: exit Plan Mode, reject plan, submit empty response

**Planning Clarification Replay**:
The behavior of showing a Planning Clarification Card again after a page reload or session restore. It is not part of the intended user flow for a card that was already displayed once in the current chat.
_Avoid_: history replay, reload restoration, persistent clarification prompt

**Planning Clarification Supersession**:
The point where a Planning Clarification Instance is overtaken by any later user message in the same chat session. A superseded clarification is not shown again when the session is restored, while a later assistant message may still create a new Planning Clarification Instance with the same content.
_Avoid_: render-seen state, frontend cache flag, browser storage marker

**Planning Clarification Instance**:
One visible Planning Clarification Card occurrence tied to a specific assistant message. Two cards with the same内容 but different assistant messages are different instances.
_Avoid_: content fingerprint, semantic duplicate, shared clarification prompt

**Plan Interaction Tool**:
A built-in Main Agent tool that emits Plan Interaction Cards through validated structured metadata.
_Avoid_: markdown JSON card, frontend text parser

**Plan Interaction Tool Availability**:
The source-scoped runtime rule that the Plan Clarification Tool and Proposed Plan Tool are available together in Plan Mode and, outside Plan Mode, only when enabled by that source's Source System Configuration. A configuration change applies to subsequent Agent requests; enabling ordinary-mode availability makes the tools callable without applying Plan Mode's planning instructions or permission restrictions.
_Avoid_: automatic Plan Mode, forced planning workflow, global tenant switch

**Plan Interaction Turn Boundary**:
The conversation boundary created when the Main Agent emits a Plan Interaction Card through a Plan Interaction Tool. The current Main Agent turn finishes the already-started tool-call batch, then ends without another reasoning step and waits for a user Plan Interaction Response, regardless of the current Plan Mode State.
_Avoid_: optional pause, prompt-only guideline, Plan Mode-only stop, sibling tool cancellation

**Plan Clarification Tool**:
The Plan Interaction Tool used by the Main Agent to ask the user a single planning clarification question.
_Avoid_: generic question tool, subagent prompt

**Proposed Plan Tool**:
The Plan Interaction Tool used by the Main Agent to present a Proposed Plan for `revise`, `execute`, or `exit_plan` review.
_Avoid_: final answer tool, permission approval tool

**Structured Interaction Envelope**:
A runtime transport contract that carries validated interactive state and user responses between an agent workflow and a specialized CoPaw interface. Its first product consumer is the W+ SOP Workspace; it does not by itself create a generic interactive-skill product surface. For W+ SOP clarification, a question batch contains one to three typed questions; supported response controls are single-select, multi-select, and free text, including evidence-backed options with an Other text path. A batch is submitted atomically after all required responses are complete. Each submitted batch becomes one auditable owning-Chat response summary carrying the clarification session ID, round number, and revision number, and it triggers exactly one subsequent Miner turn. During generation the UI may stream lifecycle progress, but answer controls appear only after the complete question batch passes envelope validation and then become available atomically.
_Avoid_: Plan Interaction Card, markdown JSON card, generic skill workspace

**W+ SOP Answer Revision**:
An append-only correction to an earlier answer in the current clarification history. Submitting it increments the revision, invalidates every downstream question, answer, and derived result, and regenerates from the corrected point. The owning Chat retains the original messages, appends a revision record containing the old value, new value, revision number, and affected rounds, and visually marks invalidated records; the Miner consumes only the current valid revision. Editing is allowed only while the session is active; a paused session must be resumed first, and completed or terminated sessions are permanently read-only.
_Avoid_: edited Chat message, deleted audit history, branching valid answers

**W+ SOP Workspace**:
The W+-specific CoPaw interface for conducting and reviewing one W+ SOP Clarification Session. It is a specialized view of the owning Chat, not a separate conversation or a generic interface for all skills. It is the sole answer-submission surface while the session is active. The owning Chat renders each current question batch as a read-only audit card with session status and a Return to SOP Workspace action; it must not duplicate active answer controls. Navigating away does not pause or mutate the session, and the normal workspace header does not expose Save and Exit; the owning Chat remains locked until the session completes or terminates.
_Avoid_: Plan Mode, standalone chat, generic skill workspace

**W+ SOP Session Control Card**:
The single mutable Chat card representing one W+ SOP Clarification Session and serving as its stable navigation or recovery entry. Its state changes in place across Active, Pending Exit, Paused, Completed, and Terminated, while question, answer, and revision audit cards remain append-only and immutable. While the session is Active or Paused, the owning Chat also derives a non-message sticky bar above the input area: Return to SOP Workspace when active and Resume SOP when paused. The sticky bar disappears after completion or termination.
_Avoid_: one resume card per transition, latest question as resume state, multiple active controls

**W+ SOP Clarification Session**:
A revisioned clarification process produced by `wplus-sop-miner`, bound to one owning Chat and containing the currently valid questions, answers, confirmed facts, and SOP result state. An owning Chat may have at most one active or paused session at a time. After that session is terminated, a new session may be created in the same Chat while the earlier session and its cards remain available as history. Producing and validating the final SOP does not by itself complete the session: the workspace first presents the result bundle for explicit confirmation, then presents the Miner's typed, evidence-backed memory candidates for explicit per-candidate consent, with a Skip All action. Approving a candidate means that its complete sanitized content has passed the W+ memory policy's privacy and deduplication checks and has been written to the corresponding W+ memory scope; a status-only approval is not sufficient. The session completes normally only after the result and every memory choice are resolved. Normal completion restores the owning Chat input immediately but leaves the user on the final workspace result view; the Chat card becomes a read-only Completed entry that can reopen the result and history. Pausing restores normal Chat input, but later ordinary Chat turns remain outside the saved SOP state; resuming uses only the session's current valid revision unless the user explicitly adds information from inside the workspace.
_Avoid_: Chat session, skill invocation, Plan Mode session

**Pending W+ SOP Exit**:
A transitional session state created when the user requests Save and Exit or Terminate while the Miner is generating. The workspace stops accepting new answers, allows the in-flight response to finish and persist, and only then applies the requested exit action so frontend and agent state remain consistent.
_Avoid_: immediate stream disconnect, discarded response, disabled exit control

**W+ SOP Recoverable Failure**:
A terminal generation failure recorded against the last stable session revision after reconnecting to the same in-flight Chat run is no longer possible. The workspace preserves that stable state and offers an idempotent Retry Current Turn, Save and Exit, and Terminate; retrying must not append a duplicate answer audit record.
_Avoid_: duplicate turn, automatic new generation, forced pause

**W+ SOP Termination Summary**:
The read-only artifact retained when a user permanently terminates an incomplete clarification session. It lists confirmed facts, explicit unknowns, unresolved questions, completed and incomplete stages, and the termination point, and must state that it is not a valid SOP. It cannot be passed to `wplus-skill-builder`.
_Avoid_: partial SOP, assumed completion, builder-ready result

**W+ SOP Result Bundle**:
The validated final output generated by the owning Agent after all clarification stages: `sop_spec.json`, the readable Markdown SOP, the static HTML SOP, and the template-based sanitized example-result HTML. A result is deliverable only after all four files have been validated and exposed through the platform file-delivery tool. Generation makes the bundle previewable and downloadable but does not complete the session. The user must explicitly confirm the bundle before memory review begins. The workspace states that confirmed artifacts are ready for a later explicit `wplus-skill-builder` invocation; it neither invokes nor embeds the Builder.
_Avoid_: automatic Builder invocation, server-synthesized download, incomplete SOP bundle, handwritten delivery URL, implicit handoff

**W+ SOP Stage Report**:
The immutable JSON, Markdown, and HTML report produced for one successful pre-run of the current clarification stage. Before locking, the workspace previews the latest validated version and lets the user request more clarification or another pre-run; superseded and confirmed versions remain read-only.
_Avoid_: final result bundle, download-only report, mutable report file

**W+ SOP Cumulative Preview**:
The JSON, Markdown, and HTML view assembled from the locked report version of every confirmed stage in queue order. It excludes the current unconfirmed report, identifies every included stage version, and is shown as supporting context only while the next stage report awaits confirmation; it is not a persistent workspace panel or the final result bundle.
_Avoid_: final SOP, artifact button list, unversioned cumulative file

**W+ SOP Authorized Memory Write**:
The policy-checked batch Agent operation started only after the user has decided every unresolved sanitized memory candidate in one workspace submission. The server atomically binds all approved candidates and their resolved JSONL targets to one Agent run, after the prior owning-Chat run is fully idle. That Agent invokes the Miner memory-store script once per approved candidate and emits one batch result containing every appended, duplicate, or failed outcome. All-rejected batches start no Agent; failed items remain retryable in a later batch. Common W+ knowledge, anonymous user preferences, and fully sanitized SOP patterns remain separate scopes. Personalized memory exists only when the caller supplied an anonymous user scope.
_Avoid_: per-candidate Agent run, incomplete decision set, request-thread write, root MEMORY.md write, inferred user scope, unbound Agent run, approval flag without policy check, duplicate append, untyped candidate

**W+ SOP Workspace V1 Privacy Scope**:
The first workspace release adds no dedicated client or server feature for detecting, blocking, or automatically redacting sensitive text in clarification answers. Existing CoPaw controls and the Miner's privacy rules remain applicable, but new workspace-specific sensitive-input enforcement is outside this feature scope.
_Avoid_: claimed PII protection, implicit redaction, weakening Miner policy

**W+ SOP Workspace Entry**:
The explicit transition from an owning Chat into a W+ SOP Workspace. A user explicitly invokes `wplus-sop-miner` either through the Chat's skill-selection interaction or by typing the exact `@wplus-sop-miner` mention in the message body; ordinary text without that exact mention never creates a new W+ entry. Either invocation first renders a clickable Chat confirmation card. Confirm idempotently creates the persisted W+ SOP Clarification Session in `GeneratingStageProposal`, then uses the already-submitted original request as the Miner's initial input and navigates to the workspace. The Miner's first output is only a validated 2–4-stage proposal; it cannot produce clarification questions until the user confirms or adjusts that queue. Existing active or paused sessions retain their Return or Resume entry.
_Avoid_: fuzzy text inference, bare skill-name inference, silent route switch, Plan Mode entry

**Plan Delegation**:
An optional Main Agent action in Plan Mode that creates a SubAgent Run through the normal delegation mechanism. Plan Delegation is allowed but is never automatic or required by Plan Mode.
_Avoid_: default plan subagent, automatic plan researcher

**Planning Readonly Policy**:
The reduced permission policy applied to the Main Agent in Plan Mode. It allows repository reading, searching, current-time lookup, readonly shell commands, and readonly SubAgent delegation while forbidding workspace mutation, tests, deployment, migration, and progress/static-copy side effects.
_Avoid_: full readonly mode, approval mode

**Explicit Plan Entry**:
A user-visible action that starts Plan Mode for a turn or session. Plan Mode is not entered silently by Main Agent inference.
_Avoid_: automatic plan detection, implicit planning

**Plan Mode State**:
The chat-session state indicating whether future turns in that chat should run in Plan Mode. One chat session has at most one current Plan Mode State.
_Avoid_: one-shot plan flag, global plan switch

**Scheduled Job**:
A recurring task definition owned by a tenant and executed by the runtime at configured times. One **Scheduled Job** can have many **Scheduled Runs**.
_Avoid_: cron config, timer task

**Scheduled Firing Count**:
The number of planned firing occurrences produced by enabled, active **Scheduled Job** definitions within a selected time range. One Scheduled Job contributes once for every matching cron occurrence. A **Scheduled Firing Count** describes planned schedule density only; it does not prove that runs are queued, delayed, executing, or backlogged.
_Avoid_: backlog count, running task count, execution count

**Scheduled Run**:
A single execution of a **Scheduled Job**, whether triggered by schedule or manually.
_Avoid_: cron call, job instance

**Scheduled Run Intent**:
A queued, claimable work item representing a due **Scheduled Run** before execution starts. Resource-aware dispatch orders **Scheduled Run Intents**; it does not rewrite the owning **Scheduled Job** definition. A **Scheduled Run Intent** may represent the parent broadcast dispatch run or a child run in the same **Dispatch Batch**. A **Scheduled Run Intent** does not create user notification state; notification remains tied to the eventual execution record.
_Avoid_: cron offset, child job priority, job rewrite

**Dispatch Batch**:
The set of **Scheduled Run Intents** for one planned firing of the same parent **Scheduled Job** for the same source. In the first rollout, the batch contains a parent dispatch intent plus its broadcast child intents; the parent intent expands or verifies the child intent set, and child intents then execute in the stable **Batch Dispatch Order**.
_Avoid_: time bucket, queue shard, child job group

**Dispatch Intent Role**:
The role of a **Scheduled Run Intent** inside a **Dispatch Batch**. A parent intent represents the batch dispatch step for the broadcast source job, while child intents represent target scheduled runs that execute existing child **Scheduled Jobs**.
_Avoid_: task type, notification type, model pool

**Dispatch Intent Queue**:
The Scheduler-owned durable queue of **Scheduled Run Intents**. The **Cron Scheduling Service** claims due intents from this queue and calls the SWE internal callback to start the referenced **Scheduled Job**; Scheduler owns ordering, locking, retry visibility, and dispatch telemetry before execution starts. Monitor may persist and display the queue records, but it does not host the dispatch loop. The first rollout scope is broadcast parent and child **Scheduled Run Intents**.
_Avoid_: local SWE queue, external scheduler callback, notification queue

**Cron Scheduling Service**:
An independent Scheduler service hosted outside both the SWE execution runtime and the Monitor observability runtime. It owns due-intent dispatch, callback handoff to SWE, immediate refill after completed scheduled work, periodic worker-capacity adjustment, and dispatch telemetry. It does not execute agent work itself; SWE remains the execution owner, and Monitor remains the observability and persistence surface.
_Avoid_: SWE dispatch worker, external scheduler job, notification worker

**Intent Dispatch Handoff**:
The transition that records a claimed **Scheduled Run Intent** as handed off to SWE through the internal cron callback. Before handoff, stale locks and callback retry backoff belong to the **Dispatch Intent Queue**. After handoff, success, failure, and notification belong to the normal **Scheduled Run** execution record; dispatch-managed completion feedback returns to Scheduler so it can update the intent and immediately make the next dispatch decision.
_Avoid_: execution completion, notification status, run result

**Broadcast Child Trigger Compatibility**:
The first dispatch-queue rollout keeps broadcast child **Scheduled Jobs** and their offset metadata for display, audit, and rollback, but child jobs are not externally scheduled. The parent broadcast dispatch step writes or verifies the child **Scheduled Run Intents** that control real execution order.
_Avoid_: child cron execution, offset-driven dispatch

**Dispatch Capacity Profile**:
A source-level runtime configuration that declares baseline worker capacity for **Scheduled Run Intents**, optionally by recurring local time window and **Dispatch Model Pool**. Its time windows are interpreted in the source's dispatch timezone, not in an individual **Scheduled Job** timezone. It seeds dispatch capacity but does not guarantee that many workers will run when runtime feedback reports pressure.
_Avoid_: fixed cron scatter, hard-coded time node, job concurrency

**Dispatch Model Pool**:
A dispatch-only resource bucket used to group **Scheduled Run Intents** that compete for the same model capacity. Its key is the resolved `provider_id/model` pair from the run's effective model. It does not change **Execution Model Slot** resolution; a run still executes with its resolved provider and model.
_Avoid_: tenant model, active model, model override

**Effective Dispatch Capacity**:
The worker capacity currently allowed by the dispatcher after combining the **Dispatch Capacity Profile** with runtime feedback such as rate limits, timeouts, latency, backlog, and success rate. It follows an additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease rule: pressure lowers capacity quickly, while stable success raises it gradually up to the active profile window's cap.
_Avoid_: configured worker count, static quota

**Worker Capacity Snapshot**:
A monitorable record of a dispatch worker capacity decision for a source and **Dispatch Model Pool**, including configured profile values, effective capacity, feedback signals, and the reason for any increase or decrease.
_Avoid_: log-only worker count, static config

**Dispatch Callback Source**:
The explicit callback-origin marker that distinguishes a SWE internal callback request from the **Cron Scheduling Service** from a legacy external scheduler callback. Batch-managed scheduled work only starts when the source is the scheduling service.
_Avoid_: inferring origin from request shape, jobParam means external, direct body means internal

**Dispatch Telemetry Record**:
A monitorable record written for dispatch-intent lifecycle events such as queued, claimed, callback-dispatched, retry-scheduled, stale-lock recovered, and linked execution completion. It supports child-task execution monitoring without replacing the normal execution record.
_Avoid_: notification record, execution replacement, debug log

**Viewer Heat Score**:
A bounded priority signal for a user or tenant, derived from recent **Scheduled Run** result reads. It combines read rate and read recency over a configured lookback window, and is used only to determine the initial **Batch Dispatch Order** within a batch.
_Avoid_: total read count, user importance, notification priority

**Batch Dispatch Order**:
The stable child-intent order computed for a **Dispatch Batch** after viewer heat, due time, retry penalty, and deterministic tie-breakers are applied. Waiting does not reshuffle the order; later claims continue from this ordered queue.
_Avoid_: fairness aging, dynamic reprioritization, starvation compensation

**Scheduled Run Boundary**:
A runtime boundary that starts scheduled work outside an incoming user HTTP request. It includes **Scheduled Job**, heartbeat, and dream execution, but not cron management API requests.
_Avoid_: cron entry, cron API, scheduler callback

**Managed Background Process**:
An OS child process explicitly started by the **Main Agent** through built-in background-process tools. It can continue after the starting tool call returns, and the same owner scope can later list it, stop it, or read its captured output. A **Managed Background Process** is owned by source, tenant, user, chat session, agent, and workspace context. It is not an async tool task, scheduled job, scheduled run, or agent execution run.
_Avoid_: async task, scheduled job, cron run, background hot patch

**Execution Model Slot**:
An optional model selection pinned to a **Scheduled Job**. If absent, each **Scheduled Run** uses the **Tenant Default Model** at execution time.
_Avoid_: model params, cron model

**Execution Model Fallback**:
The behavior where a **Scheduled Run** uses the current **Tenant Default Model** when its configured **Execution Model Slot** cannot be used. The fallback is silent in the user interface but must remain visible in operational records.
_Avoid_: hard failure, invisible fallback

**Tenant Provider Configuration**:
The tenant-scoped set of LLM provider definitions and model choices available for model selection. One **Tenant Provider Configuration** contains many provider entries and identifies at most one **Tenant Default Model**.
_Avoid_: model cache, global provider list, system model config

**Tenant Default Model**:
The active LLM selection for a tenant, used by agent work when no narrower **Execution Model Slot** is specified.
_Avoid_: global model, system default model

**Empty Model Output**:
A model-call outcome where the provider call succeeds but returns no usable assistant content for the runtime to continue or complete agent work. Text, tool-use, structured content, and reasoning content are all usable model content; empty strings, whitespace-only text, empty lists, and missing content are not. **Empty Model Output** is scoped to model-call handling, not to a whole Scheduled Run or chat turn that merely ends with no visible text.
_Avoid_: output_len=0, blank reply, empty cron output

**Source System Configuration**:
A source-scoped runtime configuration surface for behavior shared by requests from the same external source. It is not a tenant configuration and does not describe user, organization, or workspace identity.
_Avoid_: system feature configuration, system feature config, 系统特性配置, tenant config, user config

**Source Built-in Tool**:
An executable custom tool asset owned by one source and available to every tenant under that source. A Source Built-in Tool is distinct from an Agent Profile's built-in-tool configuration, and no tenant owns or may alter it.
_Avoid_: source tool config, shared tenant tool, tenant tool script

**Source Built-in Tool Contract**:
The AgentScope-compatible callable identity, purpose, and input shape of one Source Built-in Tool. Its identity is a stable restricted tool name, independent of its script filename; the first release establishes it through statically inspectable declarations for a complete tool JSON Schema, credentials, and a Python script with one fixed invocation entry point. Neither the number of active tools nor individual Schema size or complexity is capped.
_Avoid_: free-form script invocation, filename-only tool definition, dynamic Schema, dynamic credential declaration, tool-count quota, Schema complexity quota

**Source Built-in Tool Adapter**:
The Swe-owned adapter that registers a Source Built-in Tool with the regular Toolkit, validates calls against its Source Built-in Tool Contract, invokes the script across its execution boundary, and normalizes the result into the regular tool response contract.
_Avoid_: in-process uploaded script, custom model protocol, raw script result

**Source Built-in Tool Execution Boundary**:
The per-invocation boundary that runs a Source Built-in Tool with only the current tenant's workspace and authorized runtime capabilities. Every call passes the ordinary Tool Guard and approval chain and enforces the Python tenant path guard, resource boundary, and credential declaration; if any guard cannot be established, the call fails closed. The source shares tool code, never tenant data, credentials, or management authority.
_Avoid_: source-wide tenant access, shared credential context, backend-process execution, guard bypass, permissive fallback

**Source Built-in Tool Resource Boundary**:
The resource boundary for a Source Built-in Tool call. It inherits the current tenant's process CPU, memory, and concurrency limits and has the standard sixty-second timeout; a source tool cannot raise those limits.
_Avoid_: source-level resource escalation, unlimited shared tool, script-defined resource cap

**Source Built-in Tool Async Execution**:
The first-release execution mode for Source Built-in Tools. Newly added source tools run synchronously; only an Override of `execute_shell_command` inherits that Agent's existing asynchronous-execution choice.
_Avoid_: general source-tool background mode, source-owned async toggle, lost shell async choice

**Source Built-in Tool Credential Declaration**:
The explicit list of runtime environment variable names a Source Built-in Tool needs. A call receives only the declared values from its current tenant; missing values produce a structured configuration failure, and source or backend credentials are never eligible.
_Avoid_: whole tenant environment, source secret, backend secret, implicit credential access

**Source Built-in Tool Dependency Boundary**:
The first-release rule that a Source Built-in Tool is one Python source file of at most 1 MB, using only the standard library and Swe's fixed runtime interface. It cannot install, bundle, or select third-party dependencies or a custom runtime.
_Avoid_: requirements file, package upload, runtime installation, custom virtual environment, oversized source file

**Source Built-in Tool Safety Gate**:
The mandatory upload scan for every Source Built-in Tool version. A safety finding or unavailable scan rejects publication; source management cannot bypass this gate.
_Avoid_: warning-only publication, scan bypass, unscanned source tool

**Source Built-in Tool Manual Test**:
An explicitly confirmed real execution of an unpublished Source Built-in Tool version using the current Source Tool Administrator's selected Agent Profile, tenant workspace, declared credentials, and JSON input validated against the draft's Contract. Its displayed result uses the normal redaction and output limits; audit excludes test inputs, script content, and credentials. It neither publishes the version nor changes availability for other tenants.
_Avoid_: dry-run, source-wide test, implicit publish, side-effect-free preview, unchecked test input, unrelated Agent context, unbounded test output

**Source Built-in Tool Activation Boundary**:
The start of an Agent run, when it snapshots its effective Source Built-in Tool catalog. Publication, replacement, and deactivation affect the next Agent run only; a running Agent retains its starting catalog.
_Avoid_: mid-run tool mutation, next-call-only reload, retroactive catalog change

**Source Built-in Tool Historical Record**:
The retained scripts, version snapshots, content identities, and audit records for a Source Built-in Tool. The first release permits deactivation but no rollback or permanent deletion of this record.
_Avoid_: destructive source-tool deletion, erased audit trail, rollback history

**Source Built-in Tool Result Boundary**:
The rule that a Source Built-in Tool returns only a JSON-serializable business result. The Source Built-in Tool Adapter turns it into the normal tool response and applies Swe's standard failure, redaction, output-limit, conversation-record, and observability behavior. A runtime failure never falls back to a code-defined built-in, even for an Override.
_Avoid_: script-defined UI card, raw script output, custom error transport, fallback to built-in implementation

**Source Built-in Tool Network Boundary**:
The rule that a Source Built-in Tool may use only the platform's existing network egress policy. It cannot configure or bypass network destinations, and external authentication remains limited to its current tenant's declared credentials.
_Avoid_: source-controlled egress allowlist, network bypass, shared integration credential

**Source Built-in Tool Invocation Attribution**:
The source-tool identity, tool name, and published version or content identity recorded with a standard tool invocation, alongside its tenant, source, Agent, and result. It excludes call arguments, script bodies, and credential values.
_Avoid_: unattributed shared-tool call, logged tool secret, persisted script body

**Source Built-in Tool Change Notification**:
The cross-tenant notification of a Source Built-in Tool publication, replacement, or deactivation. The first release sends none; the change is observable through the next Agent run's effective catalog and source-level audit records.
_Avoid_: tenant broadcast, source-tool change message, silent untraceable change

**Source Built-in Tool Override**:
The precedence rule under which a Source Built-in Tool with the same tool name replaces a Swe code-defined built-in tool for that source. An Override retains the built-in's complete tool JSON Schema while changing only implementation and description. It never overrides a Skill- or MCP-provided tool; such a name collision is invalid.
_Avoid_: registration-order override, Schema-changing built-in override, Skill override, MCP override

**Source Built-in Tool Replacement**:
The explicitly confirmed publication of a staged same-name Source Built-in Tool draft. It is audited and affects later calls only; a call already executing retains the version with which it began.
_Avoid_: retroactive replacement, execution interruption, silent overwrite, unconfirmed replacement

**Source Built-in Tool Draft**:
An unpublished Source Built-in Tool version that has passed static validation and the Source Built-in Tool Safety Gate. A Source Tool Administrator may manually test it or explicitly publish it; it does not change any Agent's effective catalog before publication.
_Avoid_: implicit publication, unscanned test script, active source tool

**Source Built-in Tool Draft Discard**:
The explicit removal of an unpublished Source Built-in Tool Draft by a Source Tool Administrator. It does not remove published tool history; its creation, testing, and discard remain auditable as metadata.
_Avoid_: published-version deletion, unaudited draft removal, source-tool rollback

**Source Built-in Tool Draft Uniqueness**:
The rule that each source and tool name has at most one unpublished Source Built-in Tool Draft. A later upload must explicitly replace or discard the existing draft before it can become the sole draft.
_Avoid_: multiple pending versions, ambiguous publication target, parallel draft set
**Source Built-in Tool Availability**:
The source determines which Source Built-in Tools are available to an Agent, while the Agent's own enabled or disabled choice determines whether an available tool is callable for that Agent. An Override replaces implementation only and cannot bypass a disabled choice.
_Avoid_: source-forced enablement, override bypass, tenant implementation ownership

**Source Built-in Tool Default Enablement**:
A newly published non-conflicting Source Built-in Tool is initially enabled for every Agent under its source through lazily resolved source defaults, without bulk-writing Agent configuration. Each Agent may later disable it through its own tool configuration.
_Avoid_: opt-in-only source tool, permanently forced tool, bulk tenant configuration write

**Source Built-in Tool Agent Choice Persistence**:
An Agent's explicit enabled or disabled choice for a Source Built-in Tool survives that tool's source-level deactivation and later reactivation. Only an Agent that has never encountered the tool receives its default enablement.
_Avoid_: reactivation reset, source-forced re-enable, forgotten Agent choice

**Source Built-in Tool Catalog Exposure**:
The complete registration of every source-enabled Source Built-in Tool that the Agent has not disabled when an Agent run begins. It is not filtered by user intent, keywords, or on-demand discovery.
_Avoid_: lazy source tool, keyword-selected tool, partial source catalog

**Source Tool Library**:
The source-scoped management collection of Source Built-in Tools. It is presented within the Source System Configuration page but has independent storage and lifecycle from Source System Configuration. Its first release accepts complete-file upload and same-name replacement, not browser-based script editing, and does not cap the number of enabled Source Built-in Tools.
_Avoid_: source configuration JSON, agent tool list, tenant script library, browser script editor, source tool-count quota

**Source Tool Library Storage**:
The Swe-controlled, source-isolated storage of Source Built-in Tool scripts and their version history. It is separate from Marketplace storage while retaining atomic publication, content identity, and audit history.
_Avoid_: Marketplace item storage, tenant workspace storage, Source System Configuration storage, rollback store

**Source Built-in Tool Script Read Access**:
The read-only viewing or download of current and historical Source Built-in Tool scripts by a Source Tool Administrator. Ordinary tenants may see effective tool metadata but not script content.
_Avoid_: tenant script download, browser editing, public source code

**Source Built-in Tool Deactivation**:
The source-level withdrawal of a Source Built-in Tool. It affects later calls only: a deactivated Override restores the code-defined built-in, while a deactivated unique source tool is unavailable; historical versions and audit records remain for tracing only.
_Avoid_: destructive deletion, interrupted call, disabled Agent tool, rollback

**Source Built-in Tool Failure Availability**:
The rule that a runtime failure of a Source Built-in Tool affects only that invocation and does not deactivate the tool. Source-level availability changes only through an explicit Source Tool Administrator action.
_Avoid_: automatic circuit-breaker deactivation, failure-driven source mutation, implicit source disablement

**Source Tool Administrator**:
The manager or administrator authorized for the current source and permitted to upload or replace a Source Built-in Tool. A tenant administrator may use such a tool but may not manage it.
_Avoid_: tenant tool administrator, any tenant uploader

**Source System Configuration Override**:
A value explicitly saved in **Source System Configuration** that replaces the corresponding broader runtime setting for requests from that source. Missing values are inheritance, not implicit overrides.
_Avoid_: source default, tenant override, page default

**Runtime Request Identity**:
The tenant and source context that determines which runtime configuration and model selection a request observes. One **Runtime Request Identity** resolves to one **Tenant Provider Configuration** view for provider and active-model reads.
_Avoid_: cache key, auth header set, iframe context

**Background SubAgent Launch Identity**:
The **Runtime Request Identity** carried from the Main Agent runtime into a **Background SubAgent Run** so the worker observes the same source-scoped runtime configuration and model selection as its parent run.
_Avoid_: effective tenant only, provider cache key, worker tenant

**Tenant Scaffold Bootstrap**:
The tenant setup state in which a runtime scope has the required tenant-local workspace structure and baseline files. A **Tenant Scaffold Bootstrap** does not imply that the first-run conversational onboarding has happened.
_Avoid_: chat bootstrap, BOOTSTRAP.md flow, onboarding chat

**Bootstrap Chat Flow**:
The first-run conversational onboarding in which an Agent learns and records identity, style, and user preferences. A **Bootstrap Chat Flow** is separate from **Tenant Scaffold Bootstrap** and may be skipped for a tenant that still has a valid scaffold.
_Avoid_: tenant bootstrap, scaffold bootstrap, workspace initialization

**Disabled Skill**:
A managed skill package retained by the control plane but excluded from the **Skill Runtime View** and ordinary Agent skill discovery for later runs. Disabled status alone is not a filesystem security boundary.
_Avoid_: hidden skill, unregistered skill, inactive skill

**Disabled Skill Store**:
A Workspace-scoped retention area for **Disabled Skill** packages outside the conventional runtime skill path. It is managed through skill-management surfaces but remains ordinary filesystem content that generic file or shell searches may discover.
_Avoid_: skill sandbox, secure skill store, deleted skills

**Skill Management State**:
The authoritative backend-managed record of installed skills, enablement, channel availability, and configuration for one Workspace. It is accessed through skill-management surfaces rather than ordinary Workspace browsing, search, or editing.
_Avoid_: workspace skill file, user-editable skill manifest, runtime skill list

**Skill Management Surface**:
A user-visible service or API that performs a managed skill lifecycle operation, including enablement, disablement, deletion, re-import, distribution, or editing. It resolves a registered package from **Skill Management State** to either the **Skill Runtime View** or **Disabled Skill Store**; a surface may write enablement state and rely on later reconciliation for package placement when that is its established service boundary. Market may also perform an **Explicit Skill Claim**.
_Avoid_: skill-directory browser, active-directory-only management surface

**Managed Skill Package Resolution**:
The management-surface rule for locating a registered package from its **Skill Management State**. It prefers the root selected by enablement and falls back to the other managed root during a **Skill State Conflict**. An **Active Collision Promotion** takes precedence when both copies exist. A Market mutation receives both the resolved package and an explicit promotion result: it is true only when the collision changes a registered skill from disabled to enabled, so only that case requires the one Agent reload. It does not resolve **Unmanaged Skill Content** that has no registered-name collision.
_Avoid_: enumerate every skill-looking directory, manifest-only package lookup

**Active Collision Promotion**:
The default resolution of a same-name active and disabled package: the `skills/` package is retained as the **Canonical Skill Package**, the `.disabled_skills/` package is deleted, and the registered skill becomes enabled. SWE reconciliation and Market explicit management both apply this rule.
_Avoid_: preserve disabled state on active collision, ambiguous duplicate skill

**State-Preserving Distribution**:
Market distribution that installs an unregistered skill as enabled, but updates an already registered package at its managed location without changing its enablement. In particular, updating a **Disabled Skill** does not make it part of the **Skill Runtime View**.
_Avoid_: update means enable, replace-active-directory-only

**Disabled Skill Maintenance**:
Management-surface viewing, downloading, editing, and publishing of a **Disabled Skill** at its resolved package location. Maintenance changes package content or related metadata but does not change enablement.
_Avoid_: disabled means immutable, maintenance means enable

**Canonical Skill Package**:
The authoritative package content when the same skill exists in both the **Skill Runtime View** and **Disabled Skill Store**. The runtime-view copy wins for content; **Active Collision Promotion** is the exception to ordinary **Skill Management State**-driven placement and changes the registered skill to enabled.
_Avoid_: newest skill copy, enabled skill state, manifest-selected content

**Skill State Conflict**:
A disagreement between **Skill Management State** and the retained location of a skill package. A skill in conflict is unavailable to Agent Runs until the disagreement is reconciled.
_Avoid_: partially enabled skill, best-effort skill state, usable mismatch

**Unmanaged Skill Content**:
Workspace content that resembles a skill package but has no entry in **Skill Management State**. It is neither registered nor governed by disabled-skill discovery guarantees, even when it remains visible to model-initiated file or shell tools. Market may retain its legacy list, viewing, download, editing, publishing, and direct-delete behavior for this ordinary content; only an **Explicit Skill Claim** creates managed state, except that a same-name registered disabled package triggers **Active Collision Promotion**.
_Avoid_: disabled skill, automatically installed skill, runtime skill

**Explicit Skill Claim**:
A user-initiated Market enablement of **Unmanaged Skill Content** in the ordinary skill directory. After the established security scan, it creates the corresponding **Skill Management State** entry as enabled. Except for **Active Collision Promotion**, SWE never claims unmanaged content automatically, and the **Disabled Skill Store** contains only registered packages.
_Avoid_: automatic skill discovery, reconciliation registration, disabled-skill import

**Skill Runtime View**:
The current set of registered and enabled skill packages selected from a Workspace's ordinary skill directory. It excludes **Unmanaged Skill Content**; each query captures this view once at its start as a **Query Skill Snapshot**, and enablement or content changes affect subsequent queries rather than changing that query's selected set.
_Avoid_: complete skill directory, live in-flight skill view

**Query Skill Snapshot**:
The immutable, query-scoped selection of effective skills, trusted metadata, resolved package locations, and content signatures captured when a query starts. It is the consistency boundary for that query: later skill lifecycle changes apply to later queries, while a missing or changed package fails closed for the affected skill instead of being silently represented by stale snapshot metadata; the query may continue without unconfirmed Workspace Skills.
_Avoid_: global skill cache, mutable runtime list, full skill-content copy

**Console Skill Selection Panel**:
The command-style panel opened by `@` in Console chat for selecting ordered **User-Selected Skills**, including duplicates, from the current **Skill Runtime View**. A selection is represented both by an **Inline Skill Tag** in the message and by trusted structured selection context; the panel does not list built-in tools, MCP tools, or other callable runtime capabilities.
_Avoid_: tool panel, MCP menu, all-capabilities menu

**Inline Skill Tag**:
The visible, atomic `@` label for one **User-Selected Skill** occurrence inside a Console chat message, created only by confirmation in the **Console Skill Selection Panel**. It is user-message content for readability, but does not replace the trusted structured selection context that resolves the selected skill; deleting the tag removes its corresponding selection occurrence as well.
_Avoid_: trusted skill directive, tool call, execution proof

**User-Selected Skill**:
A **Skill Runtime View** member that a user explicitly selects for a single chat turn and that is admitted by the turn's **Query Skill Snapshot**. A turn may contain repeated **User-Selected Skills**; their **Skill Use Directives** are injected in selection order after duplicate runtime identifiers are removed. Each selection records user intent as structured turn context with a readable message marker, but is not evidence that the skill actually executed.
_Avoid_: skill mention, forced tool call, permanently active skill, single selected skill

**Explicit Skill Selection Activation**:
The session-scoped activation of a **User-Selected Skill** after the server validates its structured selection against the turn's **Query Skill Snapshot** and resolves its readable `SKILL.md`. It loads that skill's Hooks after the current turn's `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionStart` events, before subsequent tool calls, and persists them for the rest of the session; it does not establish **Actual Skill Use**, set a current skill, create a skill invocation trace, or prove the model read the skill document.
_Avoid_: plain-text skill mention, filename match, automatic semantic inference, confirmed skill use

**Skill Runtime Identifier**:
The stable `name` of a skill package in one Workspace: its managed skill-directory name and **Skill Management State** key. It is the identity used for runtime selection, channel availability, and injection de-duplication; a frontmatter or market `skill_id` is not a substitute.
_Avoid_: display name, frontmatter name, market skill id

**Skill Use Directive**:
A trusted instruction block for one **User-Selected Skill** whose server-resolved `SKILL.md` exists and is readable. It names the skill, describes it, and supplies that path; it requires the Agent to read the document before acting, but does not include the document's full content. With multiple directives, every document is read in directive order before task execution begins.
_Avoid_: skill prompt copy, user-supplied file path, complete skill document

**Skill-Use Enforcement**:
The runtime policy that verifies an Agent followed a **Skill Use Directive** before it acts. The first rollout has no Skill-Use Enforcement; the directive is a trusted model instruction rather than a runtime gate.
_Avoid_: prompt injection, tool attribution, guaranteed skill execution

**Actual Skill Use**:
The runtime-detected participation of a skill in a turn, established only by reading its resolved `SKILL.md` or by a tool input that targets an asset under its resolved skill directory. It is distinct from **User-Selected Skill** and is the only basis for tool-call skill attribution.
_Avoid_: selected skill, requested skill, assumed skill invocation, filename suffix match, keyword match

**Non-Authoritative Skill Signal**:
A file suffix, prose-derived keyword, tool hint, tool sequence, or MCP server name associated with a skill. It may support offline analysis but never activates, continues, attributes, or loads Hooks for a skill at runtime.
_Avoid_: activation evidence, continuation evidence, attribution evidence, hook trigger

**Skill Asset Evidence**:
A tool input that resolves to a path inside one enabled skill's effective directory. It may establish **Actual Skill Use**, but loads that skill's Hooks only when the skill was already explicitly selected or its resolved `SKILL.md` was read in the session.
_Avoid_: extension match, text substring, arbitrary workspace path, hook bootstrap

**Session Skill Hook Order**:
The deterministic hook order for a session with explicitly selected skills: tenant Hooks, then Agent Profile Hooks, then one deduplicated Hook source for each selected skill in its first-selection order. Later selections append only previously unloaded skills; normal Hook result merging resolves conflicts.
_Avoid_: arbitrary hook order, repeat-selection duplication, last-selected-first execution

**Unavailable Skill Selection**:
A user-requested skill choice that is no longer in the **Skill Runtime View** when its chat turn starts. The choice is discarded without skill guidance or selection-based attribution, while other **User-Selected Skills** in the same turn may still apply; the turn is ordinary chat only when none remain.
_Avoid_: failed chat turn, disabled skill invocation, deferred selection, auditable selection

**Skill Isolation Guarantee**:
The stronger platform-independent boundary under which disabled skill content is inaccessible to model-initiated tools on every supported operating system. **Skill Isolation Guarantee** is distinct from **Skill Discovery Suppression**.
_Avoid_: best-effort skill hiding, platform-specific skill safety, shell path filter

**Skill Discovery Suppression**:
The default disabled-skill behavior that removes a package from Agent registration, prompting, and conventional skill-directory discovery. It reduces accidental reuse but does not deny generic file searches or deliberately crafted shell access.
_Avoid_: skill isolation, filesystem sandbox, disabled-skill authorization

**Runtime Invocation Claims**:
Session, trace, tenant, and source claims that Swe passes across a runtime invocation boundary for a receiving tool or integration to interpret inside an already trusted channel. **Runtime Invocation Claims** are distinct from **Runtime Request Identity**, which is internal request context, and are not independently verifiable credentials.
_Avoid_: runtime metadata, env/header info, credential, signed token

**Execution Trace ID**:
The unique identifier for one Swe execution. Spans, Subtasks, execution records, feedback, and Runtime Invocation Claims correlate through this identifier even when several executions share one external distributed trace.
_Avoid_: B3 trace ID, batch ID, request header trace ID

**Agent Trace**:
The observability trace for one user-message execution by the Main Agent. It starts at the request's Main Agent entry point, contains that execution's agent stages, model calls, tool calls, retries, and terminal outcome, and ends when the execution finishes; a later message in the same session starts a new Agent Trace.
_Avoid_: session trace, conversation-wide trace, SubAgent Run trace

**B3 Trace ID**:
The external distributed-tracing identifier received through B3 transport metadata. It may be shared by multiple executions in one Dispatch Batch and therefore is not an execution identity.
_Avoid_: execution trace ID, Subtask trace ID, unique run ID

**Canonical Runtime Claim Name**:
The preferred external name for one **Runtime Invocation Claim** at a specific transport boundary. Canonical names are stable and transport-appropriate; compatibility aliases may exist only for boundaries that already require them.
_Avoid_: env/header info, arbitrary key, passthrough name

**Runtime Scope Claim**:
The **Runtime Invocation Claim** that names the resolved runtime isolation scope for a call, derived from the current tenant and source context when such a scope exists. A **Runtime Scope Claim** complements the logical tenant and source claims; it does not replace either one.
_Avoid_: tenant id, source id, effective tenant

**Tenant Runtime Environment Variable**:
A tenant-controlled key/value configured for exactly one **Runtime Request Identity** and supplied only at permitted runtime boundaries. It is not a process environment value, **System Configuration Environment Key**, or **Runtime Invocation Claim**.
_Avoid_: process env, backend env, global environment variable

**Runtime-Owned Claim Name**:
A claim name reserved for Swe-issued **Runtime Invocation Claims** at an invocation boundary. A **Runtime-Owned Claim Name** cannot be supplied or overridden by tenant env, tool config, passthrough headers, or handler config.
_Avoid_: user env key, custom header, configurable claim

**Runtime Invocation Claims Context**:
The backend-local execution context that carries the current **Runtime Invocation Claims** to nested tool and integration launch points during one agent run. A **Runtime Invocation Claims Context** is not itself transmitted outside Swe.
_Avoid_: global env, request identity, credential store

**System Configuration Environment Key**:
A backend-owned configuration key used by Swe itself. A **System Configuration Environment Key** is not part of user-controlled runtime env and must not be exposed through user-invoked tool subprocesses.
_Avoid_: user env, tenant env, ordinary shell env

**User Tool Subprocess Environment**:
The environment visible to a subprocess started by a user-invoked tool such as shell execution. A **User Tool Subprocess Environment** may include safe process basics and scoped runtime env, but excludes **System Configuration Environment Keys** and runtime boundary keys that expose or alter isolation internals.
_Avoid_: process env, backend env, system environment

**Built-in Shell Execution**:
The user-invoked shell command execution path owned by Swe for a tenant-scoped request. **Built-in Shell Execution** is distinct from MCP `stdio` server launches and platform maintenance subprocesses.
_Avoid_: arbitrary subprocess, MCP stdio launch, maintenance worker

**Tenant Process Resource Limits**:
A tenant-scoped policy that caps per-process CPU time and memory consumption for in-scope tenant subprocess launches. **Tenant Process Resource Limits** reduce host resource exhaustion risk; they are not a command intent classifier, command blacklist, or process-group aggregate resource budget.
_Avoid_: command blacklist, shell denylist, resource timeout, process group quota

**Process Limit Exceeded**:
A tool failure outcome where a subprocess is terminated or fails because **Tenant Process Resource Limits** were applied. **Process Limit Exceeded** is distinct from a wall-clock timeout and from an ordinary shell command failure.
_Avoid_: timeout, shell failed, command denied

**Tenant Shell Execution Slot**:
A per-tenant concurrency allowance for one in-flight **Built-in Shell Execution**. A **Tenant Shell Execution Slot** is held until the shell tool returns and its Unix process group cleanup has completed; it is not a count of every OS process forked by a script.
_Avoid_: process count, PID quota, subprocess total

**Shell Concurrency Limit Exceeded**:
A tool failure outcome where **Built-in Shell Execution** cannot start because the tenant has no available **Tenant Shell Execution Slot** within the configured wait period. **Shell Concurrency Limit Exceeded** is distinct from **Process Limit Exceeded**, because no shell subprocess has been launched yet.
_Avoid_: process limit exceeded, timeout, queue full

**Mandatory Console Channel**:
The built-in **Console Channel** is a runtime invariant that is always treated as enabled for every agent and tenant, including when no explicit channel entry has been saved yet. Users may configure its other fields, but persisted, imported, or interactive configuration must not disable it.
_Avoid_: optional console, disabled console, console toggle

**Channel Management Constraint**:
A system-managed channel rule that remains visible in channel management and tells clients which channel state is enforced rather than user-editable. A **Channel Management Constraint** may lock one field while leaving the rest of the channel configurable.
_Avoid_: frontend-only hardcode, hidden channel rule, implicit UI behavior

**Console Output Suppression**:
A runtime-only behavior that temporarily suppresses terminal printing in a specific execution path. **Console Output Suppression** does not change **Mandatory Console Channel** state and is not part of channel management.
_Avoid_: disabled console channel, channel off, console config

**Historical Tool Result Compaction**:
A conversation-history cleanup behavior that shortens previously stored tool results so the Main Agent can continue within context limits. It is separate from truncating the first result returned by a tool call.
_Avoid_: tool output truncation, file read truncation, live tool truncation

**File Read Truncation**:
A source-scoped limit on text returned by file-reading tools during the same turn that reads the file. It is separate from **Historical Tool Result Compaction**.
_Avoid_: file compaction, historical tool result compaction

**Tool Output Controls**:
The user-facing grouping for source-scoped controls over historical tool-result compaction and file-read output truncation.
_Avoid_: tool result compression configuration

**Context Window**:
The bounded model input budget available to a Main Agent turn. A **Context Window** is measured as the configured capacity used to decide whether the next turn can fit its prompt, memory, conversation history, and current user input.
_Avoid_: token bill, monthly quota, historical usage

**Persisted Context Occupancy**:
An estimate of how much of the **Context Window** is occupied by the persisted state and fixed runtime context that would actually enter the next Main Agent model input after any completed compaction. It includes system prompt and summary context, active tool definitions, effective history messages, and compacted tool results; it excludes unsent composer text, already-compacted raw history, and tokens already billed by previous model calls.
_Avoid_: token usage, usage statistics, cost usage

**Tool Call Status**:
The user-visible lifecycle state of one user-visible tool invocation during a Main Agent run. A **Tool Call Status** describes an individual tool invocation as running, successful, or failed; failed means the tool itself failed, not that the user stopped or cancelled the overall Main Agent run. The start of a tool invocation carries the running status, and the tool's returned output carries the successful or failed terminal status.
_Avoid_: tool event status, frontend tool result, trace status

**Tool Governance Status**:
The user-visible pre-execution governance state of one tool invocation when Tool Guard requires approval, the user rejects approval, or policy blocks execution. A **Tool Governance Status** is pending approval, rejected, or blocked; it is separate from **Tool Call Status**, and none of its values means that the tool itself executed and failed. Approval returns the invocation to its ordinary **Tool Call Status** lifecycle.
_Avoid_: tool failure, approval error, failed Tool Call Status, execution result

**Tool Operation Group**:
A user-visible presentation group for consecutive tool invocations that the Main Agent explicitly declares as one user-understandable task stage through a shared group identity and a validated display title. A **Tool Operation Group** appears when its first invocation starts, preserves any reasoning between its invocations in stream order, and moves into the completed response's execution-process disclosure as one group. It is collapsed by default, preserves every child invocation's ordinary independently expandable tool presentation plus its own **Tool Call Status** and **Tool Governance Status**, and is never inferred from timing, adjacency, or raw tool arguments.
_Avoid_: tool batch, time-window group, assistant turn, plan step, merged tool call

**Tool Output Frame**:
A live, user-visible presentation update for textual output produced while one tool invocation is still running. A **Tool Output Frame** belongs to exactly one **Tool Call Status** lifecycle, preserves its output source when known, is ordered only within that tool invocation, is not visible to the Main Agent as model context, and is not itself the final tool result remembered by the Main Agent.
_Avoid_: partial tool result, durable output chunk, tool memory frame, streaming object result

**Live Tool Output Area**:
The user-visible region inside a tool card where **Tool Output Frames** for that tool invocation are rendered during execution. A **Live Tool Output Area** is part of the tool presentation, not a separate assistant message in the conversation, and the final tool result becomes the card's authoritative output when it arrives.
_Avoid_: log chat message, separate output bubble, global tool log

**Terminal Tool Result Precedence**:
The rule that a successful or failed final tool result replaces the **Live Tool Output Area** as the authoritative tool-card output. If a tool is cancelled without a final result, the card may keep the last live output as cancellation context.
_Avoid_: live output as final result, partial result precedence

**Live Tool Output Guard**:
The narrow runtime protection applied before **Tool Output Frames** are sent for live presentation. A **Live Tool Output Guard** controls live output eligibility, live display limits, live replay limits, source preservation, and required redaction for real-time frames without replacing the existing final tool-result rules.
_Avoid_: tool output policy, final result policy, historical compaction policy

**Live Stream Replay**:
The best-effort restoration of live presentation events for a Main Agent run that is still active when the user reconnects. **Live Stream Replay** may include **Tool Output Frames** from the active run, but it is not historical recovery after the run has ended.
_Avoid_: chat history replay, durable tool log, completed-run output restore

**Tool Error Summary**:
A user-visible, bounded explanation attached to a failed **Tool Call Status**. A **Tool Error Summary** is not an audit record, diagnostic log, or full raw tool failure.
_Avoid_: raw tool error, tool failure log, audit error

**Tool Execution Error**:
An explicit runtime exception raised by a tool or tool-adjacent runtime path to declare that the tool invocation itself failed. A **Tool Execution Error** carries canonical failure semantics and is not just an arbitrary Python exception or plain-text output string.
_Avoid_: generic exception, plain-text tool failure, error string

**Structured Tool Failure Result**:
A persisted `tool_result` failure payload encoded in the MCP-style shape with `isError=true` and failure content blocks. A **Structured Tool Failure Result** is the canonical terminal output for failed tool invocations across local tools, MCP tools, and runtime-generated failures.
_Avoid_: plain-text failure output, ad-hoc error JSON, inferred tool failure

**MCP Availability Failure**:
A failure that prevents an enabled MCP client from becoming usable by an Agent, including failure to connect or discover its available capabilities. An **MCP Availability Failure** is distinct from an individual MCP tool invocation returning a **Structured Tool Failure Result**.
_Avoid_: MCP tool failure, optional MCP skip, successful connection log

**Hook Telemetry Event**:
A structured observability record for one Hook Runtime boundary, used to analyze hook behavior without changing the hook's runtime decision semantics. A **Hook Telemetry Event** includes the boundary-level outcome and the handler-level details that explain it, and is emitted in a log-collection-friendly shape rather than persisted as a Trace Span. For Stop, it also records a skipped completion gate with no handler execution.
_Avoid_: debug log, audit record, raw hook payload, trace span

**Hook Telemetry Log Message**:
A single-line structured application log message with a stable hook telemetry prefix and a JSON payload. **Hook Telemetry Log Message** is a normal operational signal, not an exceptional alert, and does not imply changing the global log formatter.
_Avoid_: global JSON logging, unstructured hook log, trace span, warning log

**Hook Telemetry Emission Boundary**:
The rule that a **Hook Telemetry Log Message** is emitted when at least one hook handler actually runs for a Hook Runtime boundary. Stop additionally emits it when its completion gate is skipped, with `handler_count: 0`, `handlers: []`, `execution_state: "skipped"`, and a stable `skipped_reason`; an executed Stop event records `execution_state: "executed"`.
_Avoid_: untyped Stop skip log, resolver miss hidden as handler failure, raw candidate response telemetry

**Hook Telemetry Correlation**:
The relationship between a **Hook Telemetry Log Message** and the request or trace that caused it. **Hook Telemetry Correlation** should include a trace identifier when one is available, but a missing trace identifier does not make the telemetry event invalid.
_Avoid_: mandatory trace span linkage, uncorrelated hook log

**Hook Telemetry Schema**:
The versioned JSON shape inside a **Hook Telemetry Log Message**. The schema records correlation fields, boundary-level outcome fields, and handler-level details while excluding raw hook payloads by default. `hook_telemetry.v1` records the Stop `execution_state` and, when skipped, the stable `skipped_reason` and safe candidate summary.
_Avoid_: ad-hoc log fields, raw payload schema, trace span schema

**Application Log Output Pipeline**:
The operational path that carries Swe application log records from runtime emission to process-visible outputs. An **Application Log Output Pipeline** transports ordinary and structured log records without changing their domain meaning or schema.
_Avoid_: telemetry schema, audit log, business operation log, tool output frame

**Hook Boundary Outcome**:
The merged result of one Hook Runtime boundary after all matching handlers have been resolved and combined.
_Avoid_: handler result, raw hook output, final log line

**Hook Handler Detail**:
The observable result of one hook handler within a **Hook Telemetry Event**, kept so slow, failed, blocking, or input-mutating handlers can be diagnosed. **Hook Handler Detail** stores structured metadata and redacted, bounded previews rather than full handler input or output.
_Avoid_: hook boundary outcome, raw handler payload

**Hook Payload Preview**:
A redacted and size-bounded representation of hook-adjacent text or structured data used for diagnosis without retaining the original payload.
_Avoid_: raw prompt, raw tool input, raw tool output, full updated input

**Current Tool Response**:
The successful output produced by the current tool invocation for the active `PostToolUse` boundary. A **Current Tool Response** is the tool's business output, not the full persisted `tool_result` block and not a **Hook Conversation Snapshot**.
_Avoid_: full tool result block, conversation snapshot, AgentScope acting return value

**PreToolUse Terminal Stop**:
A `PreToolUse` hook outcome with the explicitly returned `stop` decision, expressed as `{"decision":"stop","reason":"…"}` and available to every handler type, that rejects the pending tool invocation and ends the current Main Agent turn without another model call. The first `stop` in handler order is authoritative and cannot be replaced by another decision or input update; handler failures and `failPolicy:block` never imply it. Its reason, or the stable fallback `Hook requested stop`, is always emitted and persisted as the turn's final assistant message while the failed tool result remains available for tool presentation and audit as `hook_stopped`. It blocks unstarted peer calls and requests best-effort cancellation of already-started peer calls; it does not promise rollback of external side effects. It bypasses the later `Stop` hook. It is distinct from `deny` and `block`, which reject the invocation but allow the Main Agent to choose a different next action.
_Avoid_: terminal deny, blocked tool, cancelled session

**PostTool Terminal Stop**:
A `PostToolUse` or `PostToolUseFailure` hook outcome with the explicitly returned `stop` decision, expressed as `{"decision":"stop","reason":"…"}`, that ends the current Main Agent turn after the tool outcome is known. It requests best-effort cancellation of unfinished peer calls while retaining completed outcomes and without promising external rollback. It records the completed tool outcome and post-hook context before the final assistant reason, then bypasses the `Stop` hook. It does not rewrite the completed tool outcome; for a failed tool, it replaces propagation of the original tool exception while retaining that failure for presentation and audit. Hook failure, `failPolicy:block`, `deny`, and `block` never imply it. It is distinct from `deny` and `block`, which remain non-terminal for post-tool events.
_Avoid_: post-tool denial, tool rollback, completed session

**Hook Conversation Snapshot**:
A bounded hook-facing snapshot of the current session's message list at one Hook Runtime boundary, including normal user, assistant, tool-call, and tool-result messages while excluding reasoning content. A **Hook Conversation Snapshot** is not the saved transcript file and is not the full Agent state.
_Avoid_: full context, transcript contents, agent state dump, reasoning trace

**Session Skill Freshness**:
The cross-turn behavior that determines when a chat session starts using updated skill content. In this context, **Session Skill Freshness** means skill changes take effect on the next turn, not during an in-flight turn.
_Avoid_: skill hot reload, mid-turn skill reload, live skill patch

**Skill Directory Revision**:
The content identity of one skill across its full directory tree, including `SKILL.md`, scripts, references, and other skill-owned files. A **Skill Directory Revision** changes when any tracked file in that skill directory changes.
_Avoid_: SKILL.md version, single-file skill update, prompt-only skill change

**Skill Directory Freshness Token**:
A lightweight change marker for one skill directory, derived from a stable digest of each tracked file's relative path, `mtime_ns`, and size rather than strict content hashing. In this context, next-turn skill freshness checks compare the stored **Skill Directory Freshness Token** to the current one and accept heuristic rather than exact change detection.
_Avoid_: strict content revision, canonical content identity, cryptographic signature

**Session Associated Skill Set**:
The set of skills that a chat session has already depended on through explicit declaration, detector activation, or direct skill-file reading. **Session Skill Freshness** applies only to this **Session Associated Skill Set**, not to every enabled skill.
_Avoid_: all enabled skills, global active skills, workspace skill set

**Session Skill Snapshot**:
A session-state record that stores the session's **Session Associated Skill Set** together with each skill's last known **Skill Directory Freshness Token**. The **Session Skill Snapshot** is the persisted basis for cross-turn freshness checks.
_Avoid_: trace-derived skill history, transient detector state, prompt-only cache

**Skill Freshness Refresh**:
The next-turn refresh step that rebuilds prompt state and requires the model to re-read the current `SKILL.md` when a stored **Session Skill Snapshot** no longer matches the latest **Skill Directory Freshness Token**.
_Avoid_: mid-turn reload, background hot patch, user-visible skill reset

**Skill Freshness Notice**:
An internal model-facing notice added on the next turn after a **Skill Freshness Refresh**. A **Skill Freshness Notice** uses cautious wording such as detecting a skill-directory change, tells the model that current skill content supersedes assumptions formed from earlier turns, and requires the model to re-read the current `SKILL.md` before relying on that skill. It references the skill path instead of inlining the skill body, can explicitly name a directory switch, and is not exposed to the Console stream or persisted into chat history.
_Avoid_: user-visible message, persistent banner, historical chat message, silent refresh only

**Confirmed Skill Association**:
The point at which a skill becomes part of the session's durable dependency set because the runtime actually activated it, rather than merely suspecting it. Only a **Confirmed Skill Association** can add a skill to the **Session Associated Skill Set**.
_Avoid_: low-confidence guess, enabled-skill membership, possible skill match

**Market Skill Owner Set**:
The current set of users who own a market skill within one source, as resolved by market skill owner reverse lookup. A **Market Skill Owner Set** is based on current user skill state and is not a historical distribution audit; readiness workflows resolve this set server-side so the displayed owner list and checked user set share the same source of truth.
_Avoid_: assigned users, distribution history, skill install log

**Skill Readiness Skill Id**:
The `skill_id` value used to find readiness configuration and related scheduled jobs for a market skill. A **Skill Readiness Skill Id** normally comes from the market-provided skill id; before that id exists, the market skill's stable `skill_name` may be used as a fallback value while keeping the field name `skill_id`; allowed values use only letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, dot, and colon.
_Avoid_: skill_key, display name, version, historical distribution id

**Skill Readiness Configuration**:
A runtime configuration keyed by **Skill Readiness Skill Id** that declares which readiness checks apply to a market skill and what parameters those checks use. A **Skill Readiness Configuration** is stored as runtime configuration, not as a deployment-local YAML file; source identity belongs to readiness execution and result isolation rather than the base configuration key.
_Avoid_: static checklist, local YAML, global skill rule

**Skill Readiness Run**:
One asynchronous execution that checks the full **Market Skill Owner Set** for one **Skill Readiness Skill Id** within a specific source. A **Skill Readiness Run** uses `source_id` to resolve the user set, user runtime directories, scheduled jobs, credentials, and result isolation.
_Avoid_: configuration lookup, frontend scan, historical distribution audit

**Skill Readiness Run Progress**:
The observable progress counts for a **Skill Readiness Run**. `failed_users` means users whose readiness result is abnormal, not backend task failures.
_Avoid_: backend failure count, transport error count

**Skill Readiness Run Status**:
The lifecycle state of a **Skill Readiness Run** as shown to administrators. `partial` means some user results are available while non-fatal lookup or check failures prevented a fully complete run.
_Avoid_: backend process status, HTTP request status

**Skill Readiness User Result**:
The readiness outcome for one user inside a **Skill Readiness Run**. A **Skill Readiness User Result** is abnormal when any configured readiness check for that user fails.
_Avoid_: tenant health, backend task result, owner lookup row

**Skill Readiness Check Status**:
The normalized outcome of one readiness check. A check is `pass`, `fail`, or `skip`; technical errors are represented as `fail` with an explanatory message and details rather than a separate status.
_Avoid_: error status, exception category, backend failure class

**Skill Readiness Check Name**:
The stable strategy name of one readiness check inside configuration and results. New readiness check types extend this name registry and generic result payloads rather than adding per-check database columns or per-check APIs.
_Avoid_: KPI, metric column, hard-coded result field

**Profile Identity Block**:
The fixed user identity section appended to `PROFILE.md` through the agent initialization API, containing fields such as branch id, outlet organization id, position id, and customer manager id. A **Profile Identity Block** is distinct from free-form profile memories or general user preference notes.
_Avoid_: arbitrary profile content, memory note, full user info API payload

**Skill Readiness Job Binding**:
The relationship between a **Scheduled Job** and one or more **Skill Readiness Skill Id** values. A paused **Scheduled Job** still counts as a binding, while a disabled job does not count as executable for readiness checks; copied or broadcast jobs preserve the binding unless explicitly changed.
_Avoid_: skill_key binding, skill distribution record, cron tag

**Missing Associated Skill**:
An associated skill whose previously recorded directory can no longer be resolved at freshness-check time. In this context, a **Missing Associated Skill** does not trigger a refresh or notice by itself, and its snapshot entry is silently removed.
_Avoid_: failed refresh, implicit invalidation, required user repair

**Applied Skill Snapshot**:
The refreshed **Session Skill Snapshot** written immediately after a turn detects and applies a **Skill Freshness Refresh** and any one-turn **Skill Freshness Notice**. An **Applied Skill Snapshot** prevents the same freshness-token change from re-triggering on later turns.
_Avoid_: end-of-turn-only snapshot, pending snapshot, repeated refresh marker

**Session Skill Snapshot Record**:
One top-level session-state record, stored alongside other runner-managed state rather than inside agent memory state. In this context, the **Session Skill Snapshot** is a dedicated session-state key.
_Avoid_: agent memory field, embedded agent state, prompt state blob

**Session Skill Snapshot Entry**:
One persisted association record inside the **Session Skill Snapshot**, containing at least `skill_name`, `resolved_skill_dir`, and `freshness_token`. The entry tracks the concrete skill directory that the session previously depended on.
_Avoid_: name-only skill record, manifest-only reference, implicit directory lookup

**Immediate Skill Snapshot Capture**:
The persistence rule that writes a **Session Skill Snapshot Entry** as soon as a **Confirmed Skill Association** happens within the current turn. It does not wait for turn completion.
_Avoid_: end-of-turn batch write, delayed baseline capture, next-turn first write

**Associated Skill Directory Switch**:
The case where the same `skill_name` resolves to a different `resolved_skill_dir` than the one stored in the session snapshot. In this context, an **Associated Skill Directory Switch** counts as an effective skill change.
_Avoid_: name-only identity match, ignored source switch, path-agnostic reuse

**Associated Skill Withdrawal**:
The case where a previously associated skill is still present on disk but is no longer part of the current turn's effective skill set. In this context, an **Associated Skill Withdrawal** counts as an effective skill change, triggers refresh/notice, and removes the snapshot entry.
_Avoid_: silent disable drift, missing-skill ignore case, stale effective skill

**Aggregated Skill Freshness Notice**:
One per-turn **Skill Freshness Notice** that combines all effective associated-skill changes detected for that turn. It lists affected skills item-by-item instead of emitting separate notices per skill.
_Avoid_: per-skill notice spam, repeated freshness banners, fragmented model notice

**System Runtime Diagnostic**:
A periodic, Runtime Instance-scoped assessment of the Swe backend service's load, responsiveness, process resources, and storage capacity. It is broader than a liveness probe and does not execute an Agent Heartbeat.
_Avoid_: self-check, health endpoint, Agent Heartbeat

**Liveness Probe**:
A Runtime Instance signal that only proves the backend request-serving process can answer immediately. A **Liveness Probe** is not a dependency check and must not describe tenant, workspace, source configuration, database, Agent runtime, or scheduled work availability.
_Avoid_: readiness check, system self-check, health diagnostic

**Request Execution Load**:
The current load and responsiveness of the backend request-serving runtime within one Runtime Instance. It prioritizes timely request handling, streaming progress, cancellation, timeout, and scheduled-run coordination over raw throughput, and is distinct from tenant or business-runtime usage.
_Avoid_: Flask worker usage, ordinary HTTP throughput, request latency, tenant usage statistics, Agent Run count, LLM load

**Runtime Instance**:
One running Swe service container in a multi-instance deployment, independently from the business-facing instances used for user allocation.
_Avoid_: business instance, tenant, Supervisor process

**Diagnostic Run**:
One System Runtime Diagnostic collection performed by a Runtime Instance.
_Avoid_: latest-only snapshot, request-time probe, liveness response

**Diagnostic Flow Record**:
One append-only record containing the metrics collected by one Runtime Instance during one Diagnostic Run. It supports latest-state queries and historical trend analysis.
_Avoid_: EAV diagnostic item, JSON payload, LONGTEXT payload, diagnostic run ID

**Runtime Diagnostic Log**:
A machine-readable event emitted by Swe to report Runtime Instance lifecycle or a Diagnostic Flow Record for asynchronous downstream persistence.
_Avoid_: direct diagnostic database write, free-form diagnostic message, Kafka implementation in Swe

**Diagnostic Lease**:
A renewable period during which a Runtime Instance is considered present. Graceful deregistration ends it immediately; expiry makes an abnormally terminated Runtime Instance ineffective.
_Avoid_: permanent active flag, shutdown-only invalidation

**User Question Message ID**:
The stable message identifier for one user-authored question inside a Logical Chat Session. One **User Question Message ID** anchors the answer turn that responds to that question.
_Avoid_: external channel message id, generated UI message id, response id

**Answer Turn**:
The ordered message group anchored by one **User Question Message ID**, including that user question and the messages that follow it until the next user-authored question in the same Logical Chat Session. An **Answer Turn** uses the same chat-history message shape as the full conversation view.
_Avoid_: final answer text, assistant-only bubble, latest response, answer-only slice

**Stopped Answer Turn**:
An **Answer Turn** ended by an explicit user stop request before the Main Agent produced a completed response. It remains a queryable part of the **Chat Record**, preserving the anchor user question and any assistant output produced before stopping, and it does not imply that the response completed successfully.
_Avoid_: discarded turn, completed answer, cancelled chat record, partial hidden state

**Chat Stop Request**:
An explicit user operation that asks the current **Answer Turn** to stop. A **Chat Stop Request** is idempotent: repeating it does not duplicate messages or overwrite a completed or already stopped turn.
_Avoid_: stream disconnect, retry submission, session deletion, message cancellation

**Chat Submission Protocol Compatibility**:
The commitment that existing Chat submission clients continue using the established `/console/chat` request contract without a new required per-turn request identifier. A User Question Message ID remains server-issued and is conveyed through the existing response metadata path.
_Avoid_: required client request ID, third-party Chat migration, breaking submission schema, client-issued message ID

**Turn-bound Chat Stop Request**:
A **Chat Stop Request** identified by the target **User Question Message ID** as well as its Chat. It may affect only the matching active **Answer Turn**; a stale request is an idempotent no-op and cannot stop a later turn in that Chat.
_Avoid_: chat-wide stop, delayed-stop race, replacement-turn cancellation, inferred active turn

**Early Chat Stop Exception**:
The narrowly scoped form of a **Chat Stop Request** accepted before the client has received the server-issued **User Question Message ID**. It may stop only the uniquely identified, ownership-validated startup turn for that Chat; if no unique startup turn exists, it is an idempotent no-op.
_Avoid_: unrestricted msgid-less stop, chat-wide cancellation, guessed current turn, delayed-stop override

**Chat Startup Stop Locator**:
The ownership-scoped logical-session locator used only when a Console client has not yet received the server-issued Chat ID and User Question Message ID. It may resolve exactly one startup Answer Turn for an early stop; after response metadata is available, turn-bound identity is required.
_Avoid_: logical session as Chat ID, permanent session-based stop, ambiguous active-chat selection, delayed-stop lookup

**Chat Stop Target Resolution Order**:
The strict matching order for a Console Chat Stop Request: a Chat ID plus User Question Message ID identifies an exact turn; a Chat ID alone invokes constrained legacy matching of that Chat's unique current run; only a request without Chat ID may use the early logical-session locator. A Message ID without Chat ID, or no locator at all, is an idempotent no-op and never triggers fuzzy resolution.
_Avoid_: msgid-only global lookup, session fallback after Chat identity, ambiguous mixed locator, guessed active turn

**Stopped Turn Stream Closure**:
The transport behavior after a **Chat Stop Request**: the stop endpoint acknowledges asynchronous stopping, the active Chat stream closes after bounded settlement, and no new public stopped or failed SSE status is emitted. Stopped content is recovered through Chat history reads.
_Avoid_: stopped SSE status, failure SSE status, frontend stop prompt, stream-as-record

**Stopped Turn Output Freeze Boundary**:
The atomic acceptance point of a Chat Stop Request after which ordinary display output from its Answer Turn cannot enter the stream buffer or persisted history. Display events already accepted before that point remain visible and reconnectable; stopping then closes the stream after bounded settlement without adding later normal Agent output.
_Avoid_: post-stop token leak, retroactive buffer deletion, hidden pre-stop output, stopping SSE status

**Chat Stop Protocol Compatibility**:
The incremental compatibility rule for Console Chat Stop: the existing Chat ID remains accepted, the User Question Message ID is optional, and the established `stopped` response field remains present alongside asynchronous stop details. New callers provide the turn identity for exact stopping; legacy Chat-ID-only callers may stop only the uniquely running turn currently associated with that Chat and cannot defend against a delayed request racing with a later turn.
_Avoid_: stop endpoint replacement, required msgid migration, removed stopped field, unrestricted legacy chat-wide cancellation

**Chat Stop Idempotent No-op Response**:
The compatible response when a Chat Stop Request does not identify an active eligible Answer Turn, including an already settled turn, a stale turn identity, or an ambiguous legacy Chat-ID-only request. It returns successful transport status with `stopped: false` and `accepted: false`, without revealing whether the referenced turn exists or why it was ineligible.
_Avoid_: stale-stop error, target-existence disclosure, ambiguous legacy cancellation, retry-only failure

**Chat Stop Authorization No-op**:
The security-preserving treatment of a Stop request whose Chat is outside the current tenant, user, or channel ownership scope. It uses the same `200` / `stopped: false` / `accepted: false` response as other ineligible targets, while emitting a server-side security audit record and never affecting the target Chat.
_Avoid_: cross-tenant 403 distinction, Chat existence leak, partial unauthorized stop, silent security failure

**Chat Stop Acceptance**:
The server-side acknowledgement that a validated Chat Stop Request has claimed the target Answer Turn and durably or atomically entered its `stopping` phase. Acceptance does not mean the final `INTERRUPTED` outcome or stopped-turn persistence has completed; those are settled asynchronously within the graceful interruption window.
_Avoid_: completed-stop acknowledgement, model-finished response, persistence-success claim, transport-only receipt

**Chat Stop Re-acknowledgement**:
The idempotent response to a repeated Stop for the same Answer Turn while it remains in `stopping`. It returns the same accepted stopping state (`stopped: true`, `accepted: true`, `status: "stopping"`) without issuing another cancellation or changing terminal precedence.
_Avoid_: duplicate cancellation, accepted=false during stopping, repeated persistence, stop escalation

**Chat Stop Response Status**:
The coarse Chat control state returned by a Stop endpoint at request acknowledgement time: `stopping` when the target turn was accepted for bounded interruption, and `idle` for an idempotent no-op. It does not expose the eventual Answer Turn terminal outcome; stopped-turn history is authoritative after settlement.
_Avoid_: `interrupted` response guarantee, persistence result status, SSE lifecycle status, model completion status

**Accepted Chat Stop Identity Echo**:
The response rule that Stop returns the server-validated Chat ID and User Question Message ID only when it accepts that exact stopping target. An idempotent no-op or ownership-rejected request returns no target identity, preventing the response from disclosing unverified Chat or turn existence.
_Avoid_: unvalidated identity echo, authorization oracle, stale-turn confirmation, mandatory legacy message ID

**Chat Stop Graceful Interruption Window**:
The bounded five-second interval after a **Chat Stop Request** is accepted in which the Agent, tools, approvals, and workers may cooperatively settle and persist the stopped turn. Hard task cancellation is reserved for work that remains after this window; the window is not the Agent's general interrupt timeout.
_Avoid_: immediate hard cancel, sixty-second stop grace, unbounded graceful stop, post-stop normal output

**Stopped Turn Display Boundary**:
The history visibility rule for a **Stopped Answer Turn**: already persisted displayable tool calls, tool results, assistant output, and approval cards remain visible under the existing Chat redaction rules. Stopping does not preserve streaming-only deltas or rewrite persisted tool content; superseded approval cards expose their existing status.
_Avoid_: hidden stopped tools, raw delta history, stop-specific redaction, rewritten tool audit

**Answer Turn Query Identity**:
The precise identity of a queryable Answer Turn: its Chat ID and User Question Message ID. A legacy logical-session lookup may locate this pair only by searching all ownership-authorized candidate Chats, never by assuming the most recently updated Chat contains the turn.
_Avoid_: newest-chat lookup, session-only turn identity, cross-chat message inference, stale-chat 404

**Answer Turn Query Status**:
The optional top-level status returned by the Answer Turn query endpoint to describe the queried turn independently of its message list. A stopped turn returns `turn_status: "stopped"`, including when the turn contains only its admitted User Question; when assistant output exists, the same status is normalised from the stopped message metadata without changing the existing message shape.
_Avoid_: status inferred only from assistant output, missing no-output stop, frontend notification trigger, message-schema replacement

**Stopping Answer Turn Query State**:
The transient `status: "stopping"` returned by an Answer Turn query while accepted Stop settlement remains in progress. Once the stream has closed and settlement ends, the query returns `status: "idle"`; any persisted stopped outcome is then expressed separately by `turn_status: "stopped"`.
_Avoid_: stopped-as-running, terminal status before settlement, public stopped SSE state, query-time persistence guarantee

**Chat Stop Ownership Check**:
The authorization check that binds a **Chat Stop Request** to the current tenant, the owning user, and the Chat's channel before its target turn can be inspected or stopped. An unauthorized request cannot affect a running Answer Turn.
_Avoid_: chat-ID-only authorization, cross-user stop, cross-channel stop, tenant-only stop authorization

**Answer Turn Terminal Precedence**:
The single terminal outcome of an **Answer Turn** under a race between normal completion and a **Chat Stop Request**. The first operation to durably establish its terminal outcome wins; a later stop cannot replace a completed outcome, and a later completion cannot replace a stopped outcome.
_Avoid_: terminal overwrite, stop-after-complete mutation, dual terminal state, last-writer-wins outcome

**Chat Deletion Arbitration**:
The rule that Chat deletion obtains final ownership of the Chat before removing its session state and archive resources. Any active or stopping Answer Turn must be prevented from writing after deletion, so a late stop settlement cannot recreate deleted history.
_Avoid_: delete-mapping-only removal, late persistence resurrection, delete-while-running race, orphaned stopped turn

**Stopped Turn Approval Supersession**:
The invalidation of every pending human approval belonging to a **Stopped Answer Turn**. Superseded approvals retain their audit record and visible approval history, but a later approval or denial cannot resume that Answer Turn.
_Avoid_: approval deletion, approval replay, resumed stopped turn, hidden approval cancellation

**Stopping Answer Turn**:
An **Answer Turn** after an accepted **Chat Stop Request** and before its durable stopped outcome is known. It remains active only to complete bounded interruption and persistence work; it cannot emit further normal Agent output.
_Avoid_: stopped answer turn, completed answer, retryable submission, idle chat

**Stopping Turn Submission Gate**:
The temporary Chat admission boundary while an **Answer Turn** is stopping. It rejects a later user question for that Chat without consuming it, until the stopped outcome has been settled durably.
_Avoid_: queued follow-up question, attach-to-old-stream submission, concurrent answer turn, discarded follow-up

**Stopping Turn Composer Lock**:
The Console interaction rule corresponding to the **Stopping Turn Submission Gate**: after Stop acceptance, the Composer submission control remains disabled until the original Chat stream closes and the stopping phase ends. The user's unsent input remains in the Composer and can be submitted after the lock clears; no stop-specific notice is required.
_Avoid_: discarded draft, optimistic follow-up submission, permanent disabled Composer, stop error prompt

**Stopping Turn Submission Race Handling**:
The Console treatment of a `409` rejection caused by the **Stopping Turn Submission Gate**, such as a cross-tab or near-simultaneous submit race. It leaves the user input intact, adds no local Chat history, emits no stop-specific prompt, and permits explicit resubmission after the owning Chat stream closes.
_Avoid_: discarded concurrent draft, local phantom User Question, stopping error toast, automatic retry

**Stop-while-Stream-Open UI Rule**:
The Console rule for a Stop request whose transport acknowledgement fails or is delayed: Composer submission remains disabled while the original Chat stream is still open, Stop controls do not trigger automatic retries or user-facing errors, and the controls unlock when that stream closes. A user may issue another explicit Stop while the stream remains active.
_Avoid_: unlock-on-request-failure, silent follow-up admission, automatic stop retry, frontend persistence error state

**Stopping Turn Reconnect Boundary**:
The stream-reconnection rule for a **Stopping Answer Turn**: a `reconnect=true` request may attach while bounded stopping is still in progress, replay buffered display events, and wait for the stream's normal closure, but it cannot resume or produce new Agent output. After stopped settlement, stream attachment ends and the persisted **Stopped Answer Turn** is read from Chat history instead.
_Avoid_: reconnect-triggered resume, post-settlement stream replay, new output after Stop, historyless stopped turn

**Client Turn Identity Capture**:
The Console requirement to persist the server-issued `chat_id`, User Question Message ID, and logical `session_id` as soon as the Chat stream response headers arrive. Stop and reconnect use this exact tuple first; compatibility fallbacks are limited to the early pre-header window or legacy session records.
_Avoid_: session-only Stop, client-generated message identity, late identity capture, logical-session-as-chat fallback

**Stopped Turn History Refresh Policy**:
The Console policy after a stopped Chat stream closes: do not automatically refresh or rewrite the visible Chat timeline. The persisted stopped turn is read on the next user-initiated Chat load or refresh; no frontend cache, retry, or notification is added for this purpose.
_Avoid_: automatic post-stop reload, local stopped-turn cache, stop completion toast, forced timeline mutation

**Chat-scoped Stopping UI State**:
The Console rule that stopping affects only the Chat owning the **Stopping Answer Turn**. The user may switch to and submit in other Chats; returning to the stopping Chat retains its Composer lock until that Chat's original stream closes.
_Avoid_: application-wide Composer lock, cross-Chat submission rejection, hidden stopping Chat, early original-Chat unlock

**Explicit Chat Stop Invocation**:
The rule that the Console Stop endpoint is invoked only by a deliberate user Stop action. Transport aborts, network loss, Chat switching, and component disposal leave the server-side Answer Turn running and eligible for normal reconnection; they are not implicit Chat Stop Requests.
_Avoid_: disconnect-as-stop, navigation cancellation, unmount cancellation, accidental stopped turn

**Stopping Turn Control-Command Gate**:
The application of the **Stopping Turn Submission Gate** to conversation control commands such as `/clear` and `/new`. Those commands cannot change memory or checkpoint state until the stopping Answer Turn has settled.
_Avoid_: concurrent clear, concurrent new conversation, stop-command write race, early turn-state cleanup

**Stopped Turn Worker Boundary**:
The execution boundary for workers launched by a **Stopped Answer Turn**. Chat Stop best-effort cancels the synchronously selected worker and active Background SubAgent Runs owned by that turn; already completed results remain auditable, but no worker may write to, wake, or drive the stopped turn afterward.
_Avoid_: orphan worker continuation, post-stop result merge, Goal wake-up after stop, external-effect rollback

**Persisted User Question Admission**:
The condition that a user question has been durably accepted as the anchor of an **Answer Turn** before Main Agent execution begins. A question that cannot reach this condition does not begin an Answer Turn.
_Avoid_: best-effort prompt cache, started-but-unsaved question, model-first submission

**Stopped Turn Persistence Failure**:
The failure to durably record the stopped outcome or its newly produced displayable messages after a **Chat Stop Request**. It does not remove a previously admitted user question; the current policy records the server-side failure without automatic retry or frontend recovery storage.
_Avoid_: frontend failure state, retried Agent execution, recoverable frontend draft

**Interrupted Runtime Restart Boundary**:
The restart behavior for an Answer Turn interrupted by process shutdown or failure. The system does not resume or replay its Agent execution; history reflects only state that was already durable, including the admitted user question, and unresolved stop persistence is not retried.
_Avoid_: automatic Agent resumption, replayed stopped turn, stop-persistence retry, reconstructed partial output

**Stopped Turn Archive Retention**:
The retention of a **Stopped Answer Turn** when it moves from online memory into Chat history archives. Its stopped terminal metadata remains visible in the archive, while a no-output stopped marker remains in the Chat's session state until normal Chat cleanup.
_Avoid_: completed-only archive, statusless archived partial answer, discarded stopped turn, archive-only no-output marker

**Chat Stop External-Effect Boundary**:
The limit of a **Chat Stop Request** when a tool has already begun an external operation. It requests best-effort interruption of remaining execution but does not promise rollback of completed or in-progress external side effects.
_Avoid_: transactional external rollback, undo guarantee, side-effect-free cancellation

**Chat Stream Disconnect**:
The loss or closure of one client connection to an active Chat stream without an explicit **Chat Stop Request**. It does not stop the current **Answer Turn**; the run remains eligible for reconnection and normal completion.
_Avoid_: stopped answer turn, user cancellation, request failure, session termination

**Logical Chat Session**:
The stable conversation identity used to continue chat context across turns. A **Logical Chat Session** is distinct from the persisted chat record used to load or display the conversation.
_Avoid_: chat UUID, UI session row, temporary frontend id

**Chat Record**:
The persisted, displayable record for one conversation, identified by a chat UUID and returned by chat-list APIs. A **Chat Record** is distinct from the **Logical Chat Session** that carries conversational continuity.
_Avoid_: logical chat session, UI session, conversation identity

**Chat Record Last Updated Time**:
The timestamp of the most recent persisted change to a **Chat Record**. It establishes recency when Chat Records are listed.
_Avoid_: Chat Record creation time, message timestamp, Logical Chat Session time

**Conversation Compaction Boundary**:
The durable, user-visible separator within one **Chat Record** marking the point where automatic context compaction or an explicit `/compact` archived earlier messages. It appears immediately through a non-message stream event and is restored from the archive on reload; its archived-message count is the number of display-safe history messages, not rendered cards; it never represents `/new` or `/clear`.
_Avoid_: history-clear marker, new-conversation marker, summary message

**Conversation Compaction Archive**:
The Chat-Record-scoped durable store of messages removed by **Conversation Compaction Boundaries**, with exactly one committed immutable message batch per boundary. Deleting its **Chat Record** permanently deletes this archive, while existing Logical Chat Session state follows its separate retention policy.
_Avoid_: shared daily dialog file, chat transcript, session state

## Flagged Ambiguities

**"Create SubAgent"**:
Resolved to distinguish two cases: starting work creates a **SubAgent Run**, while a Main Agent may also supply a **Run-scoped SubAgent Definition** for that single run. Creating an **Agent-owned Stored SubAgent Definition** occurs only through the expert configuration center.

**"Start Built-in SubAgent By Name"**:
Resolved as ordinary exact-name selection through the compact **SubAgent Start Request**. The Main Agent provides a **SubAgent Name** and objective; a caller-supplied instruction is used only for an unresolved name's Run-scoped Definition.

**"Async SubAgent Creation"**:
Resolved to mean starting a **Background SubAgent Run** that can be queried, completed, or cancelled by run id.

**"SubAgent Subprocess"**:
Resolved as the next **SubAgent Execution Backend** for **Background SubAgent Runs**. It remains an execution mechanism, not a new kind of **SubAgent Definition**.

**"Cancel SubAgent"**:
Resolved for the next stage as **SubAgent Run Cancellation** of the subprocess process group that owns the run. If a terminal result has already been written, cancellation does not overwrite it.

**"Enter Plan Mode"**:
Resolved to require an **Explicit Plan Entry** such as a chat-window toggle or `/plan` command. Automatic silent switching is outside the next stage.

**"Plan Mode Toggle Scope"**:
Resolved as a persistent per-chat-session **Plan Mode State**, stored with the chat metadata rather than treated as a one-shot send option.

**"Plan Mode Permissions"**:
Resolved as a reduced-permission Main Agent mode. SubAgent runtime rules remain available as a separate delegation mechanism, but Plan Mode no longer depends on a default planning SubAgent.

**"Plan Approval"**:
Resolved as the `execute` **Plan Review Decision** on a **Proposed Plan**. `execute` accepts the persisted plan and can transition the chat out of Plan Mode into normal execution.

**"sessionid for Answer Turn lookup"**:
Resolved as the **Logical Chat Session** identifier known to the caller, not the persisted chat record identifier used by the chat history detail endpoint.

**"Answer Turn lookup scope"**:
Resolved as request-identity scoped. A **User Question Message ID** plus **Logical Chat Session** identifies an **Answer Turn** only within the caller's resolved tenant, source, and workspace context.

**"User Question Message ID stream delivery"**:
Resolved as a non-rendering stream notification. Delivering a **User Question Message ID** during chat streaming must not create, mutate, or fail any visible chat response card.

**"User Question Message ID delivery surface"**:
Resolved as an HTTP response header on the chat streaming response, not a renderable stream event.

**"External Answer Turn field names"**:
Resolved as using `msgid` and `sessionid` at the external API boundary while keeping **User Question Message ID** and **Logical Chat Session** as the internal domain terms.

**"User Question Message ID assignment"**:
Resolved as assigning the **User Question Message ID** before chat streaming begins and preserving that same identifier when the user question is stored in conversation memory.

**"Reconnect User Question Message ID"**:
Resolved as no new **User Question Message ID**. A reconnect attaches to an existing stream and must not be treated as a new user question.

**"Answer Turn lookup channel scope"**:
Resolved as Console-only for the current stage. Non-Console channel message identifiers and delivery rules are outside the **Answer Turn** lookup contract.

**"Answer Turn lookup response shape"**:
Resolved as a chat-history response whose `messages` contain the requested **Answer Turn**, including the anchor user question, while `chat` and `status` describe the corresponding chat record.

**"Chat detail User Question Message ID exposure"**:
Resolved as unchanged for the current stage. The full chat detail payload does not gain an additional `msgid` field solely for **Answer Turn** lookup.

**"Answer Turn anchor message shape"**:
Resolved as the same chat-history message shape used by the full conversation view, not a simplified question object.

**"Answer Turn chat record resolution"**:
Resolved as unique under the caller's request identity for **Logical Chat Session**, user, and channel. Any multiple-record handling is legacy-data compatibility, not product semantics.

**"Missing Answer Turn lookup"**:
Resolved as a not-found outcome when the requested **Logical Chat Session** and **User Question Message ID** do not identify a user question in the caller's request-identity scope.

**"Pending Answer Turn lookup"**:
Resolved as a found **Answer Turn** with no non-user messages yet. It returns the anchor user question with the chat's current status instead of a not-found outcome.

**"Non-user Answer Turn anchor"**:
Resolved as not found. An **Answer Turn** lookup only accepts a **User Question Message ID** as its anchor.

**"Execute Mode Transition"**:
Resolved to automatically close the current chat session's **Plan Mode State** before normal execution continues with the persisted Proposed Plan as accepted plan context.

**"Revise Mode Transition"**:
Resolved to keep Plan Mode active and submit the user's revision feedback as a Plan Interaction Response for replanning.

**"Exit Plan Mode Transition"**:
Resolved to automatically close Plan Mode without starting a Main Agent execution run by default, because Plan Mode is itself a special mode of the Main Agent rather than a separate worker.

**"Console Channel Toggle"**:
Resolved to the **Mandatory Console Channel** rule. Channel management may expose Console configuration, but it must not allow the effective Console enablement state to become false.

**"Console Channel vs Terminal Output"**:
Resolved as two different concepts. The always-on rule applies only to the managed **Console Channel** configuration, not to unrelated runtime terminal-output suppression behavior.

**"Plan SubAgent"**:
Resolved as outside the next Plan Mode design. The existing SubAgent runtime and delegation rules remain, but Plan Mode does not require an automatic built-in planning SubAgent.

**"Hook Instrumentation Log"**:
Resolved as a **Hook Telemetry Log Message** emitted for log collection and analysis, not a Trace Span persisted in tracing storage and not a global logging format change.

**"Plan Mode Delegation"**:
Resolved as allowed but optional. Plan Mode may expose readonly **Background SubAgent Tools**, but it does not auto-call `plan-researcher` or any other built-in SubAgent.

**"Plan Mode Tool Scope"**:
Resolved as the **Planning Readonly Policy**: `read_file`, `grep_search`, `glob_search`, `get_current_time`, readonly shell, and readonly **Background SubAgent Tools** are allowed; `write_file`, `edit_file`, `copy_file_to_static`, `update_task_progress`, mutating shell, test commands, deployment commands, and migration commands are forbidden.

**"Plan Interaction Types"**:
Resolved to support only `single_choice`, `multi_choice`, `text`, and `plan_review` in the first version.

**"Plan Card Submission"**:
Resolved as a normal next chat turn carrying **Plan Interaction Response** metadata, not a separate plan-state API call.

**"Planning Clarification Replay"**:
Resolved to not reappear after a page reload or session restore once the card has already been shown in the current chat flow.

**"Planning Clarification Instance"**:
Resolved as assistant-message scoped. A later assistant message that repeats the same clarification content is treated as a new instance and may render again.

**"Planning Clarification Submission Scope"**:
Resolved as assistant-message scoped. Submitting a Planning Clarification Card marks that assistant message's clarification instance as handled, and does not suppress a repeated clarification from a later assistant message.

**"Planning Clarification Display Memory"**:
Resolved as derived from chat history instead of browser storage. A displayed Planning Clarification Card is not hidden merely because it rendered once; it is hidden on restore only after **Planning Clarification Supersession** or a submitted response can be inferred from later chat context.

**"Planning Clarification First Display Timing"**:
Resolved as realtime stream display. A Planning Clarification Card may render as soon as its structured metadata first appears in the active assistant stream, but that displayed instance must not reappear after reload or session restore.

**"Planning Clarification Seen Moment"**:
Replaced by **Planning Clarification Supersession**. First client render alone does not make the clarification seen, resolved, or hidden on restore.

**"Planning Clarification Live Update"**:
Resolved as continuing to update the currently visible Planning Clarification Card while its live assistant response changes. The seen state only prevents replay after reload or session restore; it does not freeze the active card.

**"Dismiss Planning Clarification"**:
Resolved as a **Planning Clarification Dismissal** that closes only the current clarification, restores normal chat input, keeps Plan Mode active, and submits no message.

**"Custom Multi-choice Clarification Response"**:
Resolved as an alternative to all predefined choices. Choosing a custom response clears previously selected predefined choices, and choosing any predefined choice clears the custom response.

**"Plan Card Emission"**:
Resolved as a **Plan Interaction Tool** call. The frontend must not infer planning cards from free-form assistant text JSON.

**"Plan Interaction Tool Shape"**:
Resolved as two built-in tools: `ask_plan_clarification` for clarification cards and `submit_proposed_plan` for final plan review cards.

**"Proposed Plan Fields"**:
Resolved as `plan_id`, `title`, `summary`, `steps[]`, `risks[]`, and `verification[]`. `open_questions[]` and `confidence` are not part of the Proposed Plan protocol or user review card because they do not drive the Plan Review Decision.

**"Scheduled Job Default Model"**:
Resolved as execution-time model resolution: if a **Scheduled Job** has no **Execution Model Slot**, each run uses the current **Tenant Default Model** rather than the default model that existed when the job was created.

**"Scheduled Job Model Override"**:
Resolved as an optional **Execution Model Slot** stored on a **Scheduled Job** only when the user explicitly selects a model for that job.

**"Invalid Scheduled Job Model"**:
Resolved as **Execution Model Fallback**: if a stored **Execution Model Slot** no longer resolves at execution time, the **Scheduled Run** falls back to the current **Tenant Default Model** without a user-facing error while retaining the original slot and fallback reason in logs and execution records.

**"Broadcast Scheduled Job Model"**:
Resolved to copy the **Execution Model Slot** only when the target tenant has the same provider and model. If the target tenant lacks that model, the copied **Scheduled Job** has no **Execution Model Slot**, uses the target tenant's **Tenant Default Model**, and reports a non-failing notice in the broadcast result.

**"Text Scheduled Job Model"**:
Resolved as no **Execution Model Slot**. Text **Scheduled Jobs** do not perform model execution, so any submitted model selection is ignored and the saved job has no **Execution Model Slot**.

**"System Feature Configuration"**:
Resolved as **Source System Configuration** in this context. The configuration is scoped by source, not by tenant or user.

**"Tool Result Compression Switch"**:
Resolved as controlling **Historical Tool Result Compaction** only. **File Read Truncation** needs an independent switch.

**"PostToolUse tool_response"**:
Resolved as **Current Tool Response**: the current tool invocation's business output. It must not mean the full persisted `tool_result` block, the AgentScope `_acting()` return value, or data recovered through **Hook Conversation Snapshot**.

**"Immediate Truncation Configuration Placement"**:
Resolved as sibling configuration under **Source System Configuration**, not nested inside the **Historical Tool Result Compaction** configuration.

**"Tool Exception Contract"**:
Resolved as **Tool Execution Error** for explicit tool-declared failure, with generic exceptions preserved only as a fallback path.

**"Canonical Failed Tool Output Shape"**:
Resolved as **Structured Tool Failure Result**, using the MCP-style `isError=true` result shape rather than plain-text failure strings.

**"Streaming Tool Output Scope"**:
Resolved as **Tool Output Frame** support for long-running tools with naturally incremental textual output. Ordinary one-shot tools should not split their final result into artificial frames.

**"Initial Live Tool Output Scope"**:
Resolved as shell-style terminal tools only. MCP, file-reading, search, browser, and structured business tools do not emit **Tool Output Frames** in the first version.

**"Live Tool Output Limit"**:
Resolved as a presentation and live-replay protection for the **Live Tool Output Area** only. When the final tool result arrives, the tool card's authoritative output follows the normal final-result rules rather than the live-output limit.

**"Live Tool Output Default Limit"**:
Resolved as 64KB or 2000 lines for the **Live Tool Output Area**, whichever is reached first. When the limit is exceeded, Swe keeps the most recent live output and shows an explicit omission marker.

**"Tool Output Frame Stream Shape"**:
Resolved as a dedicated presentation event for **Tool Output Frames**, not a final tool-output message and not a model-visible content delta.

**"Immediate Truncation Defaults"**:
Resolved as preserving existing runtime behavior when a source has no explicit override. File reads keep their current default limit.

**"Disable Immediate Truncation"**:
Resolved as preserving the full immediate output for that output category. It does not mean falling back to an Agent default threshold.

**"Immediate Truncation Limit Name"**:
Resolved as `max_bytes` for immediate truncation concepts. `old_max_bytes` and `recent_max_bytes` remain specific to **Historical Tool Result Compaction**.

**"Immediate Truncation Limit Bounds"**:
Resolved as integer byte limits with a default of 50000 and a minimum of 1000 for **File Read Truncation**. No source-level maximum is defined.

**"File Read Truncation Limit Scope"**:
Resolved as output-only. **File Read Truncation** uses `max_bytes` to limit the text returned to the model and conversation, and does not introduce a source-level limit for how much data is read from storage.

**"File Read Truncation Migration"**:
Resolved as compatibility-first. If a source has no explicit **File Read Truncation** configuration, file reads continue using the historical tool-result recent limit; once **File Read Truncation** is explicitly configured, it fully owns file-read immediate truncation.

**"File Read Truncation Safety Limit"**:
Resolved as no separate non-configurable hard limit for file-read immediate output. When file-read truncation is explicitly disabled, Swe should not silently impose another truncation threshold for that category.

**"File Read Internal Protection"**:
Resolved as outside **Source System Configuration**. Swe may keep an internal storage-read protection limit, but hitting it must be visible rather than silently treated as a complete file read.

**"Tool Output Controls UI"**:
Resolved as one user-facing group with two sections: **Historical Tool Result Compaction** and **File Read Truncation**.

**"Immediate Truncation Explicit Ownership"**:
Resolved as represented by retaining the immediate truncation configuration object, at least with its `enabled` field. Default-value pruning must not erase explicit ownership of **File Read Truncation**.

**"Cron Entry"**:
Resolved as **Scheduled Run Boundary** when discussing runtime behavior. Cron management API requests remain normal HTTP requests and are outside this term.

**"Skill Reload During A Session"**:
Resolved as **Session Skill Freshness** with next-turn scope. A skill file change must affect the next turn in the same chat session, not the currently running turn.

**"Skill Update Scope"**:
Resolved as **Skill Directory Revision**, not `SKILL.md`-only monitoring. Any tracked file change inside the skill directory counts as a skill update.

**"Skill Freshness Comparison"**:
Resolved as comparing **Skill Directory Freshness Token** values for this feature, not recomputing strict **Skill Directory Revision** values on every turn.

**"Skill Freshness Token Scope"**:
Resolved as a stable digest of each tracked file's relative path, `mtime_ns`, and size across the skill directory tree, not just the root directory and `SKILL.md`.

**"Associated Skills To Monitor"**:
Resolved as the session's **Session Associated Skill Set** only. Skills that the session never associated with are outside the monitoring scope.

**"Associated Skill Persistence"**:
Resolved as persisting a **Session Skill Snapshot** in session state, not reconstructing it from tracing or other runtime records.

**"Skill Update Handling"**:
Resolved as **Skill Freshness Refresh** plus a model-only **Skill Freshness Notice**. The notice is visible to the model for one turn, but is not exposed to the Console stream or persisted into chat history.

**"When A Skill Becomes Associated"**:
Resolved as **Confirmed Skill Association** only. Low-confidence inference without actual activation must not expand the **Session Associated Skill Set**.

**"Associated Skill Disappeared"**:
Resolved as **Missing Associated Skill** with ignore semantics. If an associated skill no longer exists at next-turn freshness check time, Swe continues the turn, treats that absence as no effective skill change for the first version, and silently removes the stale snapshot entry.

**"When To Update The Session Skill Snapshot"**:
Resolved as writing an **Applied Skill Snapshot** immediately after freshness detection and notice injection for the current turn, rather than waiting for turn completion.

**"Where The Session Skill Snapshot Lives"**:
Resolved as a top-level **Session Skill Snapshot Record** in session state, parallel to `hook_overlay`, not nested under `agent`.

**"What A Session Skill Snapshot Entry Stores"**:
Resolved as at least `skill_name`, `resolved_skill_dir`, and `freshness_token`, not just the skill name alone.

**"When To Persist A Newly Associated Skill"**:
Resolved as **Immediate Skill Snapshot Capture**. A newly confirmed associated skill must be written to the top-level session snapshot immediately in the same turn.

**"Associated Skill Directory Changed"**:
Resolved as **Associated Skill Directory Switch**. If a session-associated skill name resolves to a different directory on a later turn, Swe must treat that as a real change, trigger refresh/notice, and overwrite the stored snapshot entry.

**"Associated Skill Lost Enabled/Effective Status"**:
Resolved as **Associated Skill Withdrawal**. If a session-associated skill is no longer effective for the current turn, Swe must treat that as a real change, trigger refresh/notice, and remove the stored snapshot entry.

**"Multiple Skill Changes In One Turn"**:
Resolved as a single **Aggregated Skill Freshness Notice** that lists each affected skill and its change type within the same turn.

**"Immediate Truncation Raw Configuration Display"**:
Resolved as exposing absence for **File Read Truncation** as inheriting the historical recent tool-result limit until independently configured.

**"Tool Output Controls Scope"**:
Resolved as limited to the Source System Configuration page and runtime resolution for current user-facing controls. The Agent configuration page no longer exposes historical tool-result compaction controls, while existing Agent runtime configuration remains available as inherited baseline behavior.

**"Current Session Context Usage"**:
Resolved as **Persisted Context Occupancy**, meaning the estimated persisted session context divided by the configured **Context Window**. Its user-facing breakdown is System Context, Active Tool Definitions, and Online Conversation Messages. It excludes the current unsent composer text and does not mean cumulative token usage across completed calls.

**"Context Window Capacity"**:
Resolved as the Main Agent running configuration `max_input_length`, not provider-reported model metadata. The indicator follows Swe's runtime budget because compaction and fit checks are governed by that configuration.

**"System Self-Check"**:
Resolved as **System Runtime Diagnostic**. The existing lightweight health endpoint remains a liveness probe, while the scheduled `HEARTBEAT.md` run remains an Agent Heartbeat.

**"Health Endpoint"**:
Resolved as **Liveness Probe** when referring to `/api/health/health`. It is not a readiness check and does not report dependency availability.

**"output_len=0"**:
Resolved as **Empty Model Output** only when discussing a successful model call that returns no usable assistant content. Scheduled Run or stream-level `output_len=0` remains an execution symptom and must not be treated as the canonical model-call concept.

**"Thinking-Only Model Output"**:
Resolved as not being **Empty Model Output**. Reasoning content is usable model content even when no user-visible final text is present.

**"Empty Model Output Retry Count"**:
Resolved as a fixed single retry for each model call. This retry is independent from normal transient-error LLM retry settings and still applies when normal LLM retry is disabled.

**"Streaming Empty Model Output"**:
Resolved at the whole-stream boundary. An individual empty stream chunk does not trigger an **Empty Model Output** retry; a completed stream that produced no usable model content triggers one full model-call retry.

**"Exhausted Empty Model Output Retry"**:
Resolved as an explicit model-call failure. If the fixed single retry also returns **Empty Model Output**, Swe raises a diagnostic error instead of treating the call as successfully completed.

**"Flask Worker Usage"**:
Resolved as **Request Execution Load**. Swe does not run Flask or a multi-worker web-server pool; the diagnostic reports the load and responsiveness of the single-worker Uvicorn/FastAPI backend instead of tenant-level workload statistics or Supervisor process state.

**"Diagnostic Instance"**:
Resolved as a **Runtime Instance**, meaning one running Swe service container. It is distinct from the business-facing instance records used for user allocation.

**"Logging System"**:
Resolved as the **Application Log Output Pipeline** when discussing asynchronous logging output. It does not mean changing **Hook Telemetry Log Message** schema, business operation logs, tracing storage, or **Tool Output Frames**.

**Context Reference**:
A user-selected runtime resource in a chat message. A Context Reference has one type—Skill, MCP Tool, or Workspace File—and is translated into that type's own trusted instruction context for the current turn.
_Avoid_: plain @ text, forced tool invocation, file upload

**Workspace File Context Reference**:
A Context Reference for a file owned by the current workspace, scoped to either its `media` directory or its `static` directory. It identifies an existing runtime file; it is not a new uploaded attachment.
_Avoid_: arbitrary local file, public file, chat upload

**Chat File Manager**:
The tenant-scoped browser for files in the current Agent workspace. It presents five controlled root directories and never exposes arbitrary host filesystem paths.
_Avoid_: file preview drawer, host file browser, general file storage

**Working Directory**:
The root path of the current tenant's Agent workspace. It is the default root shown when the **Chat File Manager** opens.
_Avoid_: global workspace, source checkout, host home directory

**File Manager Hidden Managed Directories**:
The two tenant-workspace directories omitted from the Working Directory view: `sessions`, which is reached through the read-only Conversation Directory, and `governance`, which is reached only through the controlled File Manager Recycle Bin. All other workspace files and directories remain visible in the Working Directory.
_Avoid_: hidden workspace policy, governance root browser, sessions bypass

**Upload Directory**:
The `media` root within the current tenant's Agent workspace, containing files uploaded through chat.
_Avoid_: attachment list, arbitrary upload location

**Download Directory**:
The `static` root within the current tenant's Agent workspace, containing files made available for download or generated for the user.
_Avoid_: browser download history, client download folder

**File Manager Recycle Bin**:
The controlled file-manager view of the current tenant's governance archive. It presents archived files by their original file identity and permits only supported restore or permanent-delete operations; it is not a browser for the `governance` root or its control records.
_Avoid_: governance directory browser, raw archive files, ordinary directory

**File Manager Restore Conflict**:
The outcome when a File Manager Recycle Bin item cannot return to its original path because a file already exists there. Restore does not overwrite the existing file and leaves the archive item available until the user resolves the conflict.
_Avoid_: overwrite-on-restore, automatic rename, lost archive item

**File Manager Permanent Deletion Confirmation**:
The explicit, irreversible confirmation required before permanently deleting a File Manager Recycle Bin item. It displays the file's original path, uses a dangerous-action affordance, and provides no undo after confirmation.
_Avoid_: one-click permanent delete, generic confirmation, undoable purge

**File Manager Entry Date**:
The weak secondary date shown for one file-manager row. Ordinary directories show the file's modification time, while the File Manager Recycle Bin shows the time the file entered the archive.
_Avoid_: file size metadata, one date meaning for every root, recycle-bin modification time

**File Manager Directory Incremental Loading**:
The independent waterfall-style loading behavior for each directory column. It loads the first 100 stable-order entries and loads later pages as the user approaches that column's bottom; Current Directory Search uses the same server-side paging behavior.
_Avoid_: one global scroll, capped flat workspace list, client-only large-directory filtering

**File Manager Symbolic Link Boundary**:
The safety rule for a symbolic link encountered in a visible workspace directory. The file manager displays it as restricted but never resolves, follows, previews, edits, downloads, deletes, or uses it as an upload destination.
_Avoid_: workspace-escaping link traversal, hidden symlink, supported symlink file operation

**File Manager HTML Preview Sandbox**:
The isolated frame used to preview an HTML file. It permits scripts to execute but withholds same-origin access, top-level navigation, popups, and downloads from the embedded document.
_Avoid_: trusted HTML preview, same-origin embedded file, unrestricted preview frame

**File Manager Breadcrumb Root**:
The first clickable segment of a file-manager breadcrumb: the active shortcut directory. It returns to that root and replaces the non-navigable `Home` label.
_Avoid_: synthetic Home breadcrumb, host filesystem root, inactive shortcut root

**File Manager Breadcrumb Reanchor**:
The navigation behavior after a user selects any file-manager breadcrumb segment. Its directory becomes the left-column starting point, its default path repopulates the following columns, and the previously visible path and file preview are cleared.
_Avoid_: partial breadcrumb rewind, preserved stale preview, in-place ancestor jump

**File Manager Directory Capability**:
The permitted user operations for a **Chat File Manager** root. Working, Upload, and Download Directories permit browsing, upload, editing, downloading, and recoverable deletion; the Conversation Directory permits browsing, previewing, and downloading only; the **File Manager Recycle Bin** permits restoring or permanently deleting archived files only.
_Avoid_: uniform directory permissions, session-file editing, recycle-bin upload

**File Manager Initial Column State**:
The state after the **Chat File Manager** enters a root directory. The root's items occupy the left column, its default first folder becomes the middle directory, and that folder's default first child folder becomes the right directory; each column lists the direct contents of its directory.
_Avoid_: synthetic Home column, selection-empty initial state, inaccessible parent layer

**File Manager Default Directory Order**:
The stable order used by the **Chat File Manager** to display directory entries and choose each default folder for the initial path. Folders precede files, and entries within each kind use case-insensitive natural name order.
_Avoid_: modification-time default order, filesystem enumeration order, files-first default path

**File Manager Default Path Termination**:
The rule when initial automatic traversal reaches a directory without a child folder before all three columns are populated. Traversal stops, the remaining columns identify the absent child-folder level, and no file is selected or previewed automatically.
_Avoid_: auto-previewed first file, fabricated directory level, file-based auto traversal

**File Manager Current Directory Search**:
The non-recursive, case-insensitive filename filter for the direct child entries of the directory represented by the middle column. It does not change the selected item or path; when no middle directory exists, it instead filters the current shortcut-root directory.
_Avoid_: workspace-wide search, recursive search, search-driven navigation

**File Manager Column Advance**:
The selection rule for the three-column browser. Selecting a folder in a non-rightmost column displays its direct children in the next column without moving the window. Selecting either a folder or a file in the rightmost column moves the three-column window one level left.
_Avoid_: double-click-to-enter, manual navigation confirmation, fixed parent-current-preview columns

**File Manager File Advance Result**:
The newly exposed rightmost column after a file triggers a **File Manager Column Advance**. It presents that file's preview or details in place, including its applicable editing action, rather than opening a separate preview overlay or leaving the column empty.
_Avoid_: nested preview modal, empty trailing column, detached file inspector

**File Manager Editable Text File**:
A file whose content is safely classified as plain UTF-8 text, including text, Markdown, and HTML files. It supports in-place editing in the **Chat File Manager**; binary, Office, PDF, image, audio, and video files do not.
_Avoid_: universal file editor, Office editing, binary-text coercion

**File Manager Large Text Preview**:
The bounded text-file reading rule. A text file of at most 1 MB is read in full and is eligible for editing; a larger text file previews only its first 1 MB, remains downloadable, and is not editable.
_Avoid_: character-count truncation, unbounded text read, large-text editing

**File Manager Save Conflict**:
The outcome when a **File Manager Editable Text File** has changed after its editor loaded it but before the user saves. The save is rejected without overwriting the current file, and the user's unsaved draft remains available for comparison or resolution.
_Avoid_: last-writer-wins save, silent overwrite, discarded draft

**File Manager Unsaved-Edit Guard**:
The confirmation required before closing the file manager or taking a navigation action that would replace an unsaved text-editor draft. The user may save, discard the draft, or cancel the pending action; the action proceeds after a successful save or an explicit discard only.
_Avoid_: implicit draft discard, navigation-first save, silent editor reset

**File Manager Recoverable Deletion**:
The file-only deletion operation that moves one file from a mutable **Chat File Manager** directory into the **File Manager Recycle Bin**. Directories cannot be deleted through the first file-manager release.
_Avoid_: recursive directory deletion, permanent ordinary-directory delete, file-system-wide trash

**File Manager Upload Availability**:
The Upload action is unavailable in the Conversation Directory and the File Manager Recycle Bin, with an explanation of that restriction. A successful upload refreshes its destination directory without selecting the new file automatically.
_Avoid_: session upload, recycle-bin upload, upload-driven file selection

**File Manager Upload Name Conflict**:
The outcome when an upload's filename already exists in its destination directory. The upload is rejected without overwriting or automatically renaming either file; the user must rename the local file and retry.
_Avoid_: overwrite upload, auto-suffixed upload, silent replacement

**File Manager Mutation Audit Record**:
The application-audit record for a file-manager upload, save, recoverable deletion, restore, or permanent deletion. It identifies the actor, time, operation, path, and result without retaining file contents; previews and downloads create no such record.
_Avoid_: file-content audit, unlogged workspace mutation, preview analytics

**File Manager File Download**:
The detail-panel action that downloads one selected file from the Working, Upload, Download, or Conversation Directory. It is unavailable in the File Manager Recycle Bin and does not create archive downloads for folders.
_Avoid_: directory ZIP download, recycle-bin download, list-row bulk download

**Conversation Directory**:
The `sessions` root within the current tenant's Agent workspace, containing conversation-scoped files.
_Avoid_: chat transcript, current browser session, global sessions directory

**On-Demand File Reference Instruction**:
The trusted instruction context created from a Workspace File Context Reference after the backend re-resolves and validates it within the current workspace. It tells the Main Agent that the file is user-selected and may be read or analyzed on demand, without inlining its contents or binary data.
_Avoid_: automatic file attachment, inline file content, unvalidated file path

**Context Reference Search**:
The non-empty query after `@` that searches the current Agent's Skills, Callable MCP Tools, and Workspace File Context References. Skills and MCP Tools retain their default presence when the query is empty; files are searched only after the user supplies a query.
_Avoid_: eager workspace file enumeration, empty-query file listing

**Context Reference Turn Scope**:
The lifecycle shared by all Context References: their typed instruction contexts apply only to the next submitted user message and are cleared immediately after that request is created. They do not persist implicitly across later conversation turns.
_Avoid_: persistent mention, conversation-scoped reference, sticky tool selection

**Context Reference Selection Set**:
The unique set of Context References chosen for one request. It deduplicates repeated choices by stable type-specific identity while allowing same-named resources of different types to coexist.
_Avoid_: duplicate mention list, name-only deduplication, persistent selection

**Context Reference Token**:
The non-editable, type-icon-bearing inline representation of a selected Context Reference in the message editor. Skills display `@skill`, MCP Tools display `@server/tool`, and Workspace Files display `@filename` with the root-prefixed path available as supplementary text; token deletion changes the structured selection set.
_Avoid_: editable reference text, text-parsed selection, untyped mention token

**Context Reference Discovery Hint**:
The footer message shown only while the user has typed `@` without a search term. It tells the user that further input searches tools and files; a non-empty query replaces it with results or an empty-result state.
_Avoid_: persistent search footer, query-time instruction

**Context Reference Result Group**:
A typed category shown in the mention overlay only when it has one or more matching Context References. Empty categories are omitted rather than rendered as empty sections.
_Avoid_: empty category section, category-level no-results row

**Context Reference Result Group Order**:
The fixed mention-overlay order for non-empty result groups: Skills, then MCP Tools, then Files.
_Avoid_: relevance-shuffled groups, files-first grouping

**Context Reference Empty Result State**:
The single mention-overlay state displayed when a non-empty Context Reference Search finds no Skills, Callable MCP Tools, or Workspace File Context References. It replaces all result groups.
_Avoid_: per-category empty states, blank search overlay

**Workspace File Search Result**:
A filename-matched Workspace File Context Reference from either the `media` or `static` directory. Both directories appear together in the single Files group, with no separate source grouping; each result category is limited to four items.
_Avoid_: media group, static group, path-content search

**Workspace File Result Path Label**:
The secondary display text for a Workspace File Search Result. It uses the source-root-prefixed relative path, such as `media/image.png` or `static/reports/summary.pdf`, to distinguish same-named files while keeping them in one Files group.
_Avoid_: filename-only file selection, separate source group

**Callable MCP Tool**:
An MCP Tool that is enabled for the current Agent and was successfully discovered for the current Context Reference lookup. A failed MCP service contributes no tool or error placeholder to the mention overlay.
_Avoid_: configured MCP tool, unavailable MCP tool, failed-server row

**MCP Tool Result Identity**:
The stable identity and primary label for a Callable MCP Tool in the mention overlay: its MCP server identifier paired with its tool name. The UI presents it as `server / tool` and uses the tool description as secondary text.
_Avoid_: tool-name-only identity, ambiguous MCP tool label

**Preferred MCP Tool Instruction**:
The typed instruction context for a selected Callable MCP Tool. It tells the Main Agent to prefer that tool when appropriate for the current request, but does not require a call or grant access beyond the tool's existing runtime availability.
_Avoid_: forced MCP invocation, tool authorization grant, automatic tool call

**Context Reference Directory Cache**:
The process-local in-memory cache of Context Reference discovery snapshots and filename indexes. It is keyed by effective tenant and Agent identity, stores no file contents, and is never shared across processes or workspace scopes.
_Avoid_: global reference cache, cross-tenant cache, file-content cache

**Context Reference Cache Freshness**:
The per-resource maximum age for a Context Reference Directory Cache snapshot, measured with a monotonic clock: five minutes for Skills and three minutes for Callable MCP Tools and the merged Workspace File filename index.
_Avoid_: one shared TTL, wall-clock expiry, indefinite discovery cache

**Context Reference Cache Hard Expiry**:
The cache-failure policy that discards an expired discovery snapshot rather than serving it when refresh fails. The failed category contributes no results, and each selected reference is independently revalidated before instruction context is created.
_Avoid_: stale-on-error reference list, unverified selected reference, stale MCP fallback

**Context Reference Cache Invalidation**:
The first-release cache invalidation policy: snapshots expire only through their configured TTLs. Configuration updates, uploads, and filesystem changes do not evict Context Reference Directory Cache entries early.
_Avoid_: mutation-triggered cache eviction, filesystem watcher invalidation, instant discovery refresh

**Context Reference Cache Admission and Capacity**:
A Context Reference Directory Cache entry is created lazily only when a user opens the mention overlay with `@`. The cache holds at most 128 tenant-and-Agent-scoped entries, removes expired entries during cache access, and evicts the least recently used entry when full.
_Avoid_: eager startup cache warming, unbounded reference cache, FIFO eviction

**Context Reference Cache Single-Flight Refresh**:
The refresh rule that permits one in-progress discovery refresh for each tenant-and-Agent scope and resource category. Concurrent cache misses wait for that refresh and consume its shared success result or shared empty failure result.
_Avoid_: cache stampede, duplicate MCP discovery, parallel directory scans

**Context Reference Cache TTL Configuration**:
The first-release decision that Context Reference Cache Freshness values are fixed backend constants, not a source-system setting, environment override, or public API configuration surface.
_Avoid_: runtime TTL tuning, cache settings UI, per-tenant cache TTL

**Context Reference MCP Discovery Budget**:
The bounded discovery window used when refreshing Callable MCP Tools: each MCP service has two seconds to respond, all services discover in parallel, and the overall overlay request waits at most three seconds. Only services that succeed within the budget contribute tools; timeout is silent.
_Avoid_: unbounded MCP discovery, serial MCP lookup, timeout error row

**Workspace File Index Capacity**:
The maximum number of files retained in each source-root portion of a Workspace File filename index. `media` and `static` each retain at most 5,000 files, selecting the most recently modified files when their directory has more.
_Avoid_: unbounded directory index, whole-directory search at request time, source-combined capacity limit

## Stop Hook Language

**Stop Hook**:
The single completion lifecycle event for every candidate Assistant Response. Each configured handler runs once and may perform its own attempt-recording or notification work. Its merged decision approves or blocks completion.
_Avoid_: BeforeStop hook, observation-only stop hook

**Candidate Assistant Response**:
A newly recorded `assistant` message in the current turn with a non-empty **Assistant Response Text Projection** and no `tool_use` block. Reasoning and passive media blocks do not disqualify it, but are excluded from the Hook input. Normal completion and **Goal Finalization Candidate Assistant Response** use this same selection rule.
_Avoid_: tool request, reasoning-inclusive Hook input, pure-text-only message requirement, earlier-turn message

**Stop Decision**:
The only valid completion decision from a Stop Hook: `allow` approves the candidate Assistant Response and `block` rejects that completion attempt. An explicit `block` may schedule a bounded automatic follow-up Agent turn; if any matched handler blocks, the merged decision blocks.
_Avoid_: deny, stop, implicit retry

**Stop Handler Failure**:
An execution failure from a Stop Hook handler. With `failPolicy: block`, it ends the request as incomplete with the failure reason and never schedules an automatic follow-up; with `failPolicy: allow`, it is diagnostic only. Only an explicit Stop Decision of `block` may request another Agent turn.
_Avoid_: retryable hook failure, silent completion failure

**Stop Migration**:
The non-compatible removal of the `BeforeStop` event. Configuration must use `Stop`; a residual `BeforeStop` configuration is invalid rather than silently translated.
_Avoid_: BeforeStop compatibility alias, automatic event translation

**Stop Trigger**:
The boundary at which a **Candidate Assistant Response** is about to complete a request. A Goal invokes it once for each Goal Finalization candidate; its internal execution turns never invoke it. Tool-hook terminal-stop paths, Finalization Fallback, and turns without a candidate Assistant Response skip Stop.
_Avoid_: tool termination audit, per-turn Goal hook, fallback completion hook

## New-session capability language

**Capability Domain**:
The broad work direction a user can choose when starting a new chat, such as document processing or data analysis. One Capability Domain contains multiple **Capabilities**.
_Avoid_: category, skill category, capability level one

**Capability**:
An actionable type of work within one **Capability Domain**, such as extraction and conversion or data cleaning. A Capability contains multiple **Scenario Presets**.
_Avoid_: subcategory, function, skill

**Source-owned Capability Domain**:
A **Capability Domain** maintained by the administrator of one Source and selectable by all tenant users under that Source. It is an editable member of that Source's capability catalog rather than a globally fixed product taxonomy.
_Avoid_: built-in category, tenant capability domain, personal category

**Source-owned Capability**:
A **Capability** maintained by the administrator of one Source beneath a **Source-owned Capability Domain** and selectable by all tenant users under that Source. It is not an Agent Profile capability or a Skill.
_Avoid_: built-in capability, tenant capability, skill

**Capability Catalog Tree**:
The strict one-to-many hierarchy in a **Scenario Preset Catalog**: each **Source-owned Capability** has exactly one **Source-owned Capability Domain** parent, and each **Source-owned Scenario Preset** has exactly one **Source-owned Capability** parent. Nodes are not shared across parents; reuse requires creating a separate preset.
_Avoid_: tag graph, many-to-many catalog, shared preset reference

**Three-level New-chat Selector**:
The visible new-chat browse-and-compose structure for a **Scenario Preset Catalog**: independent Capability Domain cards first, the selected domain's Capability tabs second, and the selected Capability's Scenario Presets in a recommended-scenario strip inside the composer third. Capability Domain browsing is visible but is not included in the submitted message.
_Avoid_: flat capability list, hidden first level, domain marker, separate scenario page

**Effective Catalog Visibility**:
The condition for a catalog node to appear in new-chat selection: the node itself and every ancestor in its **Capability Catalog Tree** are enabled. Disabling a parent does not change descendant enablement, so eligible descendants reappear if the parent is enabled again.
_Avoid_: child-state cascade, visible descendant of disabled parent, global catalog state

**Catalog Leaf Deletion**:
The deletion rule for a **Scenario Preset Catalog**: only a node without children may be deleted. A Capability or Capability Domain must first have its descendants deleted or moved; disabling is the non-destructive way to hide a subtree.
_Avoid_: cascade delete, recursive removal, orphaned catalog node

**Scenario Preset**:
A named, reusable task starting point under one **Capability**. It supplies an editable **Prompt Draft** and may declare **Preset Context References**; selecting it does not execute the task or become a system instruction.
_Avoid_: scenario, Prompt, command, automatic task

**Prompt Draft**:
The user-editable starting text placed in a new chat's composer when a **Scenario Preset** is selected. It is ordinary user-message content until the user submits it.
_Avoid_: system prompt, instruction, skill directive, generated answer

**Prompt Draft Replacement**:
Selecting a **Scenario Preset** immediately replaces the composer Prompt Draft with that preset's Prompt Draft. The user may then edit it freely before submission.
_Avoid_: confirmation dialog, append-by-default, locked template text

**Preset Context Reference**:
A Skill or Callable MCP Tool declared by a **Scenario Preset** and resolved against the current chat's available or provisionally session-enabled Context References. Resolved references are sent through the ordinary structured context-reference parameter and backend revalidation, but are not inserted as `@` text into the user's **Prompt Draft**.
_Avoid_: raw prompt injection, hidden authorization grant, visible @ token

**Implicit Preset Context Binding**:
The automatic association of a **Scenario Preset**'s resolved **Preset Context References** with the next submitted message. The association is created by selecting the preset, is not independently shown or removed in the composer, and remains subject to the ordinary Context Reference Turn Scope and backend revalidation.
_Avoid_: user-editable capability list, persistent session binding, authorization bypass

**Session-scoped Marketplace Resource View**:
The temporary Skill and MCP availability granted to one Chat session from resources declared by its selected **Scenario Preset**. It may make a marketplace resource usable when it is absent from the tenant or Agent's persistent configuration, lasts until that Chat session ends, and never writes to tenant or Agent configuration.
_Avoid_: tenant installation, Agent config mutation, permanent marketplace enablement

**Temporary Marketplace Resource Binding**:
The session-lifetime association between a **Scenario Preset** and its resolved marketplace Skill or MCP resource. It is released with the Chat session; each actual use still goes through the resource's normal availability, credential, Tool Guard, and approval checks.
_Avoid_: turn-only reference, persistent distribution, permission grant

**Temporary MCP Credential Resolution**:
The rule for a marketplace MCP in a **Session-scoped Marketplace Resource View**: resolve only a credential reference already owned by the current tenant, allow credential-free public services, and omit the MCP when required credentials cannot be resolved. A Scenario Preset never stores or transfers secret values.
_Avoid_: Source credential sharing, preset API key, cross-tenant secret copy

**Latest Marketplace Resource Resolution**:
The version policy for a marketplace Skill or MCP named by a **Scenario Preset**: the preset stores the stable resource identity without pinning a version, and a new Chat session resolves the latest eligible market version at session initialization.
_Avoid_: preset-pinned version, silent historical version reuse, arbitrary unversioned package

**Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot**:
The immutable set of marketplace Skill and MCP versions resolved when a **Scenario Preset** initializes a Chat session. A market update does not change this snapshot during the session; a later Chat session resolves the latest eligible versions again.
_Avoid_: hot-reloaded market resource, live latest lookup, per-turn version drift

**Session Marketplace Snapshot Recovery**:
The rule for reopening an existing Chat: restore its saved **Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot** rather than resolving the selected Scenario Preset or market latest versions again. A snapshot entry whose resource or tenant credential is no longer valid becomes unavailable without replacing the rest of the snapshot.
_Avoid_: refresh-time latest lookup, preset reapplication, partial snapshot rewrite

**Scenario Context Lock**:
The lifecycle boundary of new-chat capability selection: a **Scenario Preset** may be chosen only while a Chat has no submitted user message. After the first message is submitted, its **Capability Marker**, Prompt Draft history, and session resource snapshot remain fixed; changing scenario requires creating a new Chat.
_Avoid_: mid-chat scenario switch, per-turn capability replacement, mutable session context

**Capability Catalog Identity**:
The immutable, opaque ID of a Capability Domain, Capability, or Scenario Preset. IDs are globally unique within one Source's **Capability Catalog Tree**, remain stable when names or parents are edited, and are never reused after deletion; names are display fields rather than references.
_Avoid_: name-based identity, parent-scoped ID, recycled catalog ID

**Sibling Catalog Name Uniqueness**:
The naming constraint for one catalog parent: after trimming surrounding whitespace and applying case-insensitive comparison, sibling Capability Domains, Capabilities, or Scenario Presets may not share a name. Identical names under different parents are allowed.
_Avoid_: globally unique display name, case-sensitive duplicate, name as foreign key

**Catalog Node Relocation**:
The administrator operation that moves a Capability to another Capability Domain or a Scenario Preset to another Capability within the same Source. Relocation preserves the node's **Capability Catalog Identity**, name, Prompt Draft, and resource bindings; only later new Chats use the new tree path, while existing Chats retain their original context.
_Avoid_: delete-and-recreate move, ID rewrite, historical Chat rewrite

**Unavailable Preset Resource**:
A marketplace Skill or MCP named by a Scenario Preset that cannot be resolved when a new Chat initializes, including a delisted or deleted market resource. The preset remains intact, available resources still bind without a terminal-user warning, and an administrator may repair the binding without automatic catalog mutation.
_Avoid_: automatic preset deletion, silent full failure, rewritten scenario binding

**Preset MCP Service Binding**:
The declaration of one complete marketplace MCP service by a Scenario Preset. It provisionally makes that service and its callable tool set available in the Chat's **Session-scoped Marketplace Resource View**, rather than selecting or preferring one individual MCP tool.
_Avoid_: `server + tool` binding, MCP tool preference, unrestricted host tool access

**Session MCP Tool Snapshot**:
The immutable callable tool set discovered for one **Preset MCP Service Binding** when a Chat session initializes. Service-side tool additions, removals, or changes do not alter the active session's tool set; a later Chat session discovers a new set.
_Avoid_: live MCP tool discovery, per-turn service expansion, hot-reloaded tool list

**Session-scoped Marketplace Skill Activation**:
The activation of a marketplace Skill in a **Session-scoped Marketplace Resource View**. The Chat's first scenario message receives the same trusted Skill-use instruction semantics as an explicit `@Skill` selection, without adding visible `@skill` text; the activated Skill remains available for later messages in that Chat without repeated instruction injection.
_Avoid_: visible Skill marker, per-turn duplicated directive, tool-only Skill exposure

**Resource-free Scenario Preset**:
A Scenario Preset that has a Prompt Draft but declares no marketplace Skill or MCP service. It remains a valid selectable scenario and creates no Session-scoped Marketplace Resource View.
_Avoid_: invalid empty binding, Skill-required preset, MCP-required preset

**Unselected New-chat State**:
The initial state of a new Chat before a user explicitly chooses a Scenario Preset. The composer remains an ordinary empty prompt, carries no Capability Marker or marketplace-resource snapshot, and may submit a free-form request directly.
_Avoid_: default scenario, automatic prompt fill, implicit capability selection

**Catalog Browsing Selection**:
The non-semantic initial expansion of the first enabled Capability Domain and its first enabled Capability by catalog order in an **Unselected New-chat State**. It only determines which Scenario Presets are displayed and does not select a Scenario Preset, fill a Prompt Draft, or create a session resource snapshot.
_Avoid_: default scenario selection, automatic context binding, initial prompt value

**Persistent-resource Preference**:
The source-selection rule for a Scenario Preset resource: use the current tenant or Agent's already enabled Skill or MCP configuration when it corresponds to the market resource; create a **Session-scoped Marketplace Resource View** only when no corresponding persistent resource exists. The Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot records the actual source and version used.
_Avoid_: scenario-overrides-tenant configuration, always-market resource, ignored persistent capability

**Submit-time Scenario Resolution**:
The resource-initialization boundary for a selected Scenario Preset: selecting, switching, or cancelling a preset before the first message changes only local composer state; the backend resolves the current catalog entry, resource bindings, persistent-resource preference, credentials, and market versions only when the first message is submitted, then persists the resulting session snapshot.
_Avoid_: click-time installation, front-end authority, pre-submit MCP connection

**Stale Scenario Selection**:
The submit-time outcome when a selected Scenario Preset was deleted or disabled after the composer displayed it. The backend refuses session initialization, the user's Prompt Draft remains editable, and the stale Capability Marker and pending bindings are cleared instead of silently submitting a free-form message; relocation alone does not make a stable-ID selection stale.
_Avoid_: silent downgrade, discarded draft, move-invalidated ID

**Scenario Catalog Change Scope**:
The visibility boundary for an administrator's Scenario Preset Catalog mutation. An unsubmitted new Chat resolves the current catalog entry and bindings at first-message submission without overwriting its edited Prompt Draft; an existing Chat retains its historical Capability Marker and Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot, and never receives catalog changes retroactively.
_Avoid_: live draft overwrite, historical message rewrite, active-session catalog hot reload

**Scenario Catalog Administrator**:
An existing Super Manager or manager authorized for the current Source who may maintain that Source's Scenario Preset Catalog. It is a permission use of the established Source configuration role model, not a separate role; ordinary users may only read the catalog's effective visible entries.
_Avoid_: scenario-specific role, client-side-only authorization, tenant-wide catalog editor

**Sibling Catalog Order**:
The explicit order of Capability Domains, Capabilities, or Scenario Presets among siblings in one parent scope. New nodes and relocated nodes enter at the destination's end; administrators persist later ordering explicitly, and new-chat display plus Catalog Browsing Selection follow that order.
_Avoid_: creation-time-only order, alphabetical default order, global catalog sequence

**Scenario Catalog Management Page**:
The single Source-administrator settings page that presents the whole Scenario Preset Catalog as a three-level tree. It manages nodes in place and opens a Scenario Preset detail drawer for its Prompt Draft and marketplace-resource bindings; it does not split each catalog level into an independent page.
_Avoid_: three disconnected settings pages, flat prompt-library editor, cascading-delete manager

**Empty Scenario Catalog**:
The initial Scenario Preset Catalog state for a Source before its Scenario Catalog Administrator creates entries. The product ships no seeded Capability Domains, Capabilities, or Scenario Presets; visual drafts are interaction references only and never become Source content automatically.
_Avoid_: draft-derived seed data, global default catalog, automatic Source content provisioning

**Scenario Selector Availability**:
The condition for displaying three-level capability selection in a new Chat: the Source must have at least one complete, effectively visible Capability Domain-to-Capability-to-Scenario Preset path. Without one, the welcome view presents only the ordinary free-form composer.
_Avoid_: empty selector, partial catalog navigation, blocked free-form Chat

**New-chat Catalog Read Freshness**:
The first-release update behavior for Scenario Preset Catalog display: a new Chat welcome view reads the current effective catalog when it opens, without live push or polling for an already-open view. Refreshing or opening another new Chat obtains later changes, while selection and submit-time validation remain authoritative server-side.
_Avoid_: real-time catalog subscription, stale-client authority, client-only catalog validation

**Empty Catalog Management State**:
The Scenario Catalog Management Page state when its Source has no catalog entries. It gives concise guidance to create a Capability Domain and offers only that creation action; it does not seed examples or reproduce visual-draft content.
_Avoid_: automatic sample catalog, empty tree without guidance, draft-content import

**Source-wide Market Binding**:
The administrator's ability to bind any currently listed market Skill or MCP resource under the Source to a Scenario Preset, regardless of the administrator's own institution visibility. The binding is revalidated against each end user's institution at submit time; an institution-ineligible resource becomes an **Unavailable Preset Resource** for that user.
_Avoid_: administrator-bbk snapshot, user-wide bypass, source binding as authorization

**Invalid Catalog Resource Binding**:
A retained Scenario Preset resource binding whose market resource is no longer visible or resolvable in the management view. It displays its stable identity, last-known label, and invalid reason; an administrator may remove or replace it, but may save the scenario without an immediate repair.
_Avoid_: hidden stale binding, blocked scenario edit, automatic binding deletion

**Silent Preset Resource Degradation**:
The runtime behavior when one or more Scenario Preset resources are unavailable: continue the first message with the remaining available resources and do not show the end user a partial-availability notice or resource failure details. Administrators can diagnose and repair the binding through the management view and server diagnostics.
_Avoid_: terminal-user degradation alert, all-or-nothing scenario failure, exposed credential reason

**Resource-empty Scenario Session**:
A Chat initialized from a Scenario Preset for which no declared marketplace Skill or MCP resource can be resolved. The Atomic Scenario Marker and Prompt Draft still submit, the session snapshot records no active preset resources, and the Agent continues with its ordinary capabilities without a terminal-user warning.
_Avoid_: rejected scenario, hidden fallback session, resource-error dialog

**Free-form Chat Session**:
A Chat whose first message is submitted from an Unselected New-chat State. It contains neither a Capability Marker nor a Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot and uses only the ordinary persistent capabilities of the current Agent.
_Avoid_: implicit scenario, default marketplace session, inferred capability selection

**Eligible Market Resource**:
A market Skill or MCP resource that is currently available for new Scenario Preset bindings under the Source and visible to at least one institution. Inactive, delisted, or otherwise unresolved resources cannot be newly bound, while older bindings to them remain as Invalid Catalog Resource Bindings for repair.
_Avoid_: inactive resource selection, hidden stale binding, runtime-only eligibility

**Scenario Session Initialization Log**:
The structured application log emitted when a first message initializes a Scenario Preset Chat. It identifies the Source, Chat, catalog-node IDs, each resource's type, stable ID, actual source, resolved version, availability outcome, and a non-sensitive initialization result; it excludes Prompt Draft content, Skill content, MCP configuration, credentials, and user input. It is diagnostic output rather than a separate audit database, file, or usage aggregate.
_Avoid_: full-prompt audit copy, secret-bearing resource log, dedicated scenario audit store

**Session Snapshot Metadata**:
The existing Chat metadata that persists a Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot so an existing Chat can restore its exact scenario resources after refresh or reopening. It is session state, not a separate Scenario Session Audit Record or analytics store.
_Avoid_: external snapshot database, durable audit log, refresh-time market lookup

**Scenario Session Agent Lock**:
The rule that a Chat initialized from a Scenario Preset retains the Agent selected when its first message creates the Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot. Later Agent-selection changes cannot alter that Chat's execution Agent, so persistent-resource preference and temporary resource bindings remain coherent.
_Avoid_: mid-session Agent switch, resource snapshot rebinding, mutable scenario Agent

**Idempotent Scenario Initialization**:
The Chat-ID-scoped rule for first-message scenario setup: only the first successful submission creates and persists a Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot; concurrent or retried submissions reuse it without resolving market versions again or emitting duplicate success initialization logs. A failed initialization writes no snapshot and may be retried.
_Avoid_: duplicate snapshot creation, retry-time latest lookup, partial failed snapshot

**Scenario Session Resource Cleanup**:
The lifecycle cleanup for a Chat's Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot and Chat-exclusive temporary MCP connections. Permanent Chat deletion removes both immediately while leaving persistent tenant and Agent resources untouched; a recoverable deletion retains the snapshot until permanent deletion, and restoration resumes the original snapshot without a new market resolution.
_Avoid_: persistent resource deletion, delete-time latest lookup, unrecoverable snapshot loss

**Preset Resource Binding Order**:
The administrator-defined order of marketplace Skill bindings within one Scenario Preset. New bindings append to the end, removed-and-readded bindings receive a new end position, and the order determines trusted Skill-use instruction order without being shown in the user's message; MCP service bindings are snapshotted separately and do not participate in this Skill instruction order.
_Avoid_: alphabetical injection order, market response order, user-visible resource order

**Capability Marker**:
The user-visible `@`-prefixed label for the selected second-level **Capability**, added to the submitted message when a **Scenario Preset** is selected. It omits the parent Capability Domain, is ordinary user-message text for communicating the selected capability, and does not select a Skill or MCP Tool; those references remain governed only by the **Implicit Preset Context Binding**.
_Avoid_: Skill mention, MCP mention, trusted selector, hidden directive

**Atomic Scenario Marker**:
The non-editable **Capability Marker** prefix coupled to a selected **Scenario Preset**, placed before its Prompt Draft in the submitted user message. Users may modify the Prompt Draft freely, but deleting the whole marker cancels the scenario selection and removes its **Implicit Preset Context Binding**.
_Avoid_: independently editable marker, stale hidden binding, removable capability panel

**Marker-only Scenario Message**:
A valid first user message consisting only of an **Atomic Scenario Marker** after the user clears its Prompt Draft. It retains the selected Scenario Preset, initializes its Session Marketplace Resource Snapshot, and is not rejected merely because no task body follows the marker.
_Avoid_: required non-empty draft, invalid capability-only message, implicit scenario cancellation

**Source-owned Scenario Preset**:
A **Scenario Preset** maintained by the administrator of one Source and shared as read-only selectable content by all tenant users under that Source. It is not a user-private preset or an Agent Profile asset.
_Avoid_: tenant preset, personal template, Skill preset

**Scenario Preset Catalog**:
The Source-managed hierarchy of **Source-owned Capability Domains**, their **Source-owned Capabilities**, and their enabled **Source-owned Scenario Presets** exposed to new-chat capability selection. Catalog management is separate from submitting a **Prompt Draft**.
_Avoid_: prompt library, skill registry, chat history

**Goal Runtime**:
The host-owned, persistent control layer that advances one **Goal** across Main Agent turns while enforcing lifecycle, resource, and verification rules. It does not replace the Main Agent Runtime or create a second delegation system.
_Avoid_: agent loop, autonomous tool, subagent orchestrator

**Goal**:
A stable user-desired outcome, expressed as a revisioned Contract with completion criteria and execution constraints. A Goal is distinct from its changeable Plan and the individual Tasks used to advance it.
_Avoid_: plan, task list, agent turn, SubAgent Run

**Goal Runtime First Phase**:
The first deliverable of Goal Runtime: one Goal at a time with durable state, automatic continuation, pause/resume/cancel, budgets, and independent natural-language completion review. Task-graph and multi-Goal orchestration are later phases.
_Avoid_: task graph, multi-goal scheduler, full team orchestration

**Goal Scope**:
The immutable execution identity captured when a Goal is created: its Tenant, Source, Agent Profile, and Chat. At most one non-terminal Goal belongs to one Chat, while Goals in distinct Chats can proceed independently.
_Avoid_: tenant-wide Goal, Agent-wide Goal, globally serialized Goal

**Goal Lifecycle State**:
The host-authoritative state of a Goal: `ACTIVE`, `WAITING`, `PAUSED`, `BLOCKED`, `LIMITED`, `INTERRUPTED`, `COMPLETE`, or `CANCELLED`. `COMPLETE` and `CANCELLED` are terminal; the remaining states are recoverable only through their defined transition conditions.
_Avoid_: Agent-declared completion, terminal wait, failed-as-blocked

**Waiting Goal**:
A non-terminal Goal with no useful immediate Main Agent action and one or more explicit external wake events, such as approval, a Background SubAgent result, or a managed job result.
_Avoid_: polling loop, idle ACTIVE Goal, user-paused Goal

**Blocked Goal**:
A non-terminal Goal for which no valid action can currently advance the Goal and resolution needs user input, a Direct Goal Edit, or a change in an external condition. Budget exhaustion is not a Blocked Goal.
_Avoid_: action failure, waiting Goal, resource limit

**Limited Goal**:
A non-terminal Goal stopped by an exhausted resource budget. In the first phase, the only budget is a code-defined Main Agent turn limit; it is not user-visible or user-adjustable, but the user may explicitly resume the Goal to reset that limit and begin a new execution-budget cycle.
_Avoid_: Blocked Goal, completed budget, automatic retry, user-configurable budget

**Goal Turn Resolution**:
The structured recommendation returned after one Main Agent turn: `continue`, `wait`, `propose_completion`, or `blocked`, with the evidence or wake conditions required by that recommendation. The Goal Runtime validates it and alone performs the resulting lifecycle transition or continuation scheduling.
_Avoid_: natural-language handoff, Agent-controlled state transition, implicit loop continuation

**Goal Contract**:
The user-confirmed agreement for one Goal Revision that defines objective, completion criteria, constraints, and autonomy boundary. It is immutable within that Revision and is not weakened or replaced by planning, Steering, or execution; only a user-submitted Direct Goal Edit can create a later Revision. The code-defined Goal Turn Budget remains an internal runtime guard outside the Contract.
_Avoid_: Agent plan, prompt summary, mutable task list, inferred permission

**Goal Constraint**:
A user-confirmed execution boundary within a Goal Contract, represented in the first phase as short `must_preserve` and `must_not_do` text lists. It is distinct from a Completion Criterion and does not itself grant or revoke tool permission; actual enforcement remains with the existing Tool Guard and approval path.
_Avoid_: acceptance test, Tool Guard policy, implementation plan, constraint compiler

**Goal Autonomy Boundary**:
The user-confirmed statement of which Goal actions may proceed automatically and which must use existing approval. It never enlarges the ordinary runtime's Tool Guard, data-access, sandbox, or approval permissions.
_Avoid_: Goal-specific privilege, approval bypass, inferred consent

**Goal Creation Confirmation**:
The user's explicit approval of a proposed Goal Contract before the Goal Runtime creates and activates its persistent Goal. A direct-start interaction may shorten the UI path but does not omit the user-visible Contract or its confirmation.
_Avoid_: inferred acceptance, first-turn execution, silent autonomous start

**Completion Criterion**:
A Goal Contract acceptance condition expressed in natural language as a requirement, observable assertion, verification method, and expected outcome. It directs an independent Completion Judge, rather than requiring an executable verification DSL or constituting an objectively repeatable proof by itself. A Main Agent cannot satisfy a criterion by self-assessment.
_Avoid_: Agent self-assessment, raw tool-call criterion, executable-only acceptance condition, automatically provable success claim

**Goal Verification Method**:
The Contract-bound natural-language guidance for how a Completion Judge should assess a Completion Criterion. It can describe commands, file or artifact state, API state, database state, or other relevant observation without being an executable tool-call schema.
_Avoid_: Main Agent self-assessment, raw Tool Call contract, completion-time criterion replacement

**Completion Judge**:
The runtime-owned, independent model evaluation that decides whether each Contract-bound Completion Criterion is satisfied after a Main Agent proposes completion. It uses the Goal's creation-time frozen Effective Model in a separate, restricted invocation; receives the active Contract and candidate evidence; may use existing read-only tools under ordinary Tool Guard, path-boundary, and approval rules; and returns an accept or reject decision with a reason. It cannot modify the Contract, execute Goal work, or declare new acceptance conditions.
_Avoid_: Main Agent self-assessment, mutating reviewer, free-form Contract rewrite, unguarded tool access

**Bounded Completion Review Package**:
The minimum runtime-built context supplied to a Completion Judge: the frozen active Contract and Revision, the Main Agent's completion proposal and candidate evidence references, relevant current-turn tool results, and authorised read-only workspace access. It excludes the full Chat history, the Main Agent's private Plan and reasoning, and raw Background SubAgent logs.
_Avoid_: full transcript replay, private-plan review, hidden reasoning audit, raw SubAgent-log injection

**Plan Mutability Boundary**:
The distinction between the user-confirmed Goal Contract and the private, changeable Initial Execution Plan. Replanning may replace steps, risks, or next focus without changing the Goal; changing the Contract requires a Direct Goal Edit and a new confirmed Goal Revision.
_Avoid_: user-approved steps, immutable plan, plan-as-acceptance, silent Contract rewrite

**Contract-bound Completion Review**:
The rule that each Completion Criterion and its natural-language Verification Method are approved as part of the Goal Contract. A Main Agent may provide candidate evidence and a Completion Judge may perform proportionate read-only inspection, but neither may replace, weaken, or add acceptance conditions during execution.
_Avoid_: completion-time criterion substitution, easier acceptance test, Agent-chosen Contract rewrite

**Goal Turn Budget**:
The code-defined first-phase resource guard limiting how many Main Agent turns one Goal may consume in its current Budget Cycle. It is not included in the Goal Contract or exposed for user modification; exhaustion transitions the Goal to `LIMITED`, never to `COMPLETE`.
_Avoid_: completion threshold, success quota, user-configurable budget, automatic completion

**Goal Budget Cycle**:
One allocation of the code-defined Goal Turn Budget for a Goal. A user-initiated resume from `LIMITED` resets the budget and starts a new Budget Cycle; a Direct Goal Edit does not reset it or silently restart the Goal.
_Avoid_: automatic retry, budget increase, hidden continuation

**Goal Wake Event**:
An observed event permitted to reactivate a Waiting Goal in the first phase: completion of a Goal-owned Background SubAgent Run, resolution of a pending tool approval, or an explicit user interaction in that Goal's Chat. Other external asynchronous systems are not Goal wake sources in this phase.
_Avoid_: polling signal, generic event bus, arbitrary external callback

**Goal-owned Background SubAgent Run**:
An existing Background SubAgent Run started by a Main Agent while advancing one Goal and recorded with that Goal's identity. It remains a bounded delegated task rather than a Goal owner; it may produce candidate evidence only for its matching Goal.
_Avoid_: Goal SubAgent type, autonomous Goal owner, recursive Goal worker

**Goal Steering**:
Any user input received while a Goal is active, initially treated as execution context for the current Goal Revision. It cannot change the Contract through text; a Contract change requires the separate Direct Goal Edit interaction.
_Avoid_: implicit Goal change, model-proposed revision, unclassified user message

**Goal Edit**:
The user-initiated direct editing of a confirmed Goal Contract's objective, Completion Criteria, verification definitions, Constraints, or Autonomy Boundary. Main Agent output and ordinary Steering cannot initiate or populate a Goal Edit; after explicit user confirmation, it creates a new Goal Revision.
_Avoid_: model-proposed revision, implicit Contract patch, text-only scope expansion

**Direct Goal Edit**:
The Goal Monitor interaction in which the user edits Contract fields directly and submits the complete resulting Contract. Submission is confirmation; it does not block or interrupt the current Main Agent turn, and the new Contract becomes a pending Goal Revision applied atomically at the current turn's settlement boundary.
_Avoid_: Agent-suggested edit, conversational auto-edit, partial field mutation, blocking edit

**Goal Control Command**:
A user-requested pause, resume, cancellation, or confirmed Direct Goal Edit control recorded durably against a Goal. In the first phase, every command takes effect only at the current Main Agent turn's settlement boundary: that turn may finish and persist its result, but no subsequent continuation begins before the Goal Runtime applies the command.
_Avoid_: immediate turn interruption, discarded turn result, concurrent transition

**Goal Control Command Precedence**:
When more than one Goal Control Command is pending at a Main Agent turn's settlement boundary, the Goal Runtime applies only the highest-precedence command: `CANCEL`, then Direct Goal Edit, then `PAUSE`, then `RESUME`. Lower-precedence commands remain auditable as superseded and cause no intermediate state transition.
_Avoid_: command race, sequential conflicting transition, last-write-wins control

**Goal Stop Competition Rule**:
The outcome when a Chat Stop Request races an explicit Goal Monitor control for the same active Goal turn. A Goal Monitor cancellation that first durably establishes `CANCELLED` prevails; otherwise Chat Stop ends the current Answer Turn as stopped and transitions the Goal to `INTERRUPTED`. Pause, Direct Goal Edit, and Resume do not replace the stopped interruption outcome, but remain subject to their normal later lifecycle rules.
_Avoid_: stop-as-cancel, interrupted-then-cancelled overwrite, pause-over-stop, edit-over-stop

**Goal Turn Settlement Boundary**:
The point after a Main Agent naturally finishes its current reasoning loop and any tool call it has already begun, when the Goal Runtime persists its result and applies pending Goal Control Commands. The first phase does not preempt an executing tool or promise stronger cancellation than the ordinary runtime provides.
_Avoid_: forced tool termination, immediate control transition, rollback guarantee

**Completion Review Rejection**:
A Completion Judge decision that a Contract-bound Completion Criterion is not yet satisfied or lacks sufficient evidence for acceptance. It prevents `COMPLETE` and becomes durable review feedback for the next Main Agent turn; an evidence-insufficiency rejection must state what further evidence is needed. It is not by itself a Blocked Goal.
_Avoid_: successful completion, Main Agent opinion, immediate blocker

**Completion Review Circuit Breaker**:
The first-phase liveness guard that independently moves a Goal to `BLOCKED` after three consecutive Completion Review Rejections for one Completion Criterion within one Goal Revision. Other criteria do not consume that counter; its recorded review feedback remains available for user Steering, Direct Goal Edit, or a later manual resume.
_Avoid_: terminal failure, budget limit, unrelated verification failures

**First-phase Goal Liveness Guard**:
The limited first-phase protection against useless autonomous work: the code-defined Goal Turn Budget and the Completion Review Circuit Breaker. Generic progress scoring or no-progress detection is intentionally deferred until it can be defined with auditable evidence.
_Avoid_: subjective progress score, heuristic stagnation blocker, unlimited continuation

**Goal Store**:
The MySQL-backed source of truth for Goal lifecycle state, Goal Revisions and their Contracts, turn settlements, verification evidence/results, pending control commands, and budget cycles. In-memory execution state and Chat Checkpoint projections are not authoritative Goal state.
_Avoid_: workspace JSON state, Chat Checkpoint, process-local Goal registry

**Goal Execution Owner**:
The single application instance that owns a Goal's continuous first-phase execution through its sticky request. It runs automatic continuation turns locally until a terminal or user-controlled boundary; cross-instance lease acquisition and scheduler takeover are outside the first phase.
_Avoid_: distributed Goal lease, scheduler owner, cross-Pod continuation

**Interrupted Goal**:
The `INTERRUPTED` non-terminal Goal State, entered when its Goal Execution Owner stops before a later continuation can begin. Its last persisted turn settlement remains authoritative; it does not auto-resume after instance loss, and the user must explicitly resume it from the Chat.
_Avoid_: user-paused Goal, orphaned Goal takeover, automatic crash recovery, lost Goal state

**Frozen Goal Execution Identity**:
The Goal Scope's Tenant, Source, Agent Profile, and effective Model captured when a Goal is created. They cannot be switched during any Revision of that Goal; a Direct Goal Edit changes only the Contract.
_Avoid_: mid-Goal Agent switch, live model rebinding, revision-based identity change, mixed-identity evidence

**Goal Runtime Snapshot**:
The MySQL-persisted recovery state for a Goal: current lifecycle state and Revision, active Contract, progress and verified evidence references, remaining Goal Turn Budget, active Goal-owned Background SubAgent links, and pending Goal Control Commands. It is sufficient to resume after a later user action without making runtime logs authoritative.
_Avoid_: audit log snapshot, conversation summary, in-memory-only state

**Goal Audit Log**:
Structured append-only runtime logging for Goal creation and confirmation, turn resolutions, verification calls/results, state transitions, control commands, and interruption/recovery. Entries are correlated by Goal ID, Revision, and turn ID; complete prompts and raw tool output are not required as the audit record.
_Avoid_: MySQL audit table, unstructured print trace, prompt archive

**Structured Goal Turn Resolution**:
The runtime-validated JSON envelope returned by a Main Agent turn. It contains a `decision` (`continue`, `wait`, `propose_completion`, or `blocked`) plus the decision-specific summary, next focus, evidence references, wake conditions, completion proposal, or blocker fields. Invalid or unparseable envelopes do not trigger continuation or completion.
_Avoid_: Markdown status guess, regex-derived lifecycle, free-form handoff

**In-request Goal Event Loop**:
The single Goal Execution Owner's asynchronous loop that runs automatic turns and waits without LLM polling for permitted Goal Wake Events. It resumes directly on those events within the sticky request and deliberately has no independent cross-instance scheduler in the first phase.
_Avoid_: polling loop, distributed scheduler, background takeover

**Explicit Goal Control Action**:
A dedicated user-facing control/API operation for pausing, resuming, cancelling, or opening a Direct Goal Edit. It writes a Goal Control Command directly instead of interpreting ordinary chat text; ordinary user messages remain Goal Steering and cannot alter the Contract.
_Avoid_: text-command parsing, implicit pause keyword, hidden cancellation

**Goal Monitor Entry**:
A compact Chat-level shortcut, analogous to the existing Background SubAgent monitor entry, that opens a user-requested Goal summary and its explicit control actions. It follows the same compact-trigger and collapsible-panel interaction pattern, while remaining a distinct Goal surface rather than a displayed SubAgent Run. Goal intermediate turns do not create Chat timeline messages.
_Avoid_: per-turn chat message, exposed internal reasoning, SubAgent Run display

**Goal Monitor Summary**:
The user-visible content of a Goal Monitor Entry: the confirmed Goal Contract summary, lifecycle state, passed and remaining Completion Criteria, the latest verification failure or waiting/blocker reason, and current turn sequence, with available explicit controls. It excludes internal Plans, model reasoning, raw tool output, and raw SubAgent logs.
_Avoid_: reasoning trace, full execution transcript, SubAgent detail pane

**Goal Contract Confirmation Card**:
The blocking Composer interaction that presents only a proposed Goal Contract for explicit user confirmation before Goal creation and activation. The private Initial Execution Plan is not shown for approval. Rejecting it returns to ordinary message editing and does not create a Goal or begin autonomous execution.
_Avoid_: assistant timeline message, implicit acceptance, post-start contract edit

**Goal-ready Proposal**:
The redesigned `submit_proposed_plan` output that directly contains a user-reviewable Goal Contract Draft. It replaces the legacy generic title/summary/steps/risks/verification plan shape, rather than mapping those fields into Goal terms after submission; any execution approach remains internal Main Agent context.
_Avoid_: legacy Proposed Plan mapping, inferred Contract, user-approved step list

**Goal Contract Draft**:
The proposed pre-confirmation form of a Goal Contract, containing the objective, Completion Criteria with deterministic verification definitions, Constraints, and Autonomy Boundary. User confirmation makes it the active Contract for a new Goal or Goal Revision.
_Avoid_: accepted execution plan, mutable task list, implicit Goal

**Goal Contract Draft Execution Summary**:
The read-only, immediately derived overview within an editable Goal Contract Draft. It summarizes the current objective, Completion Criteria count, Constraint counts, and Autonomy Boundary presence; it is not a Contract field and is never independently stored or confirmed.
_Avoid_: editable summary, persisted proposal field, separate contract description

**Goal Contract Draft Detail View**:
The temporary expanded or collapsed presentation of an editable Goal Contract Draft. A newly received Draft starts expanded; validation failures keep it expanded so the invalid field remains actionable. Its visibility is not stored as Goal state or Contract data.
_Avoid_: persisted user preference, contract lifecycle state, collapsed validation error

**Goal Contract Draft Composer Card**:
The compact, blocking Goal Contract Draft presentation that temporarily replaces the Chat Composer. It adopts the Draft's sectioned visual language without becoming an independent full-page workflow: its Detail View scrolls within a bounded height so the existing conversation remains visible.
_Avoid_: standalone Draft page, timeline message, cloned page shell, full-height Composer replacement

**Goal Contract Draft Detail Toggle**:
The dedicated accessible button that controls the Draft Detail View. It is the only collapse/expand trigger, exposes `aria-expanded`, uses explicit expanded/collapsed labels, and supports Enter or Space keyboard activation.
_Avoid_: clickable summary surface, hidden toggle semantics, pointer-only disclosure

**Goal Contract Draft Local Edit**:
An unconfirmed edit held only in the current Goal Contract Draft card. It does not create or alter a Goal and is discarded when the page or card is left; the Draft must disclose this before confirmation.
_Avoid_: saved draft, server-side proposal revision, resumable pre-confirmation contract

**Goal Contract Draft Exit**:
The explicit return from a Draft card to ordinary message editing. It never creates a Goal; when Unconfirmed Changes exist, the user must confirm their discard before the card closes.
_Avoid_: implicit confirmation, silent discard, Contract cancellation

**Goal Contract Draft Navigation Loss**:
The intentional loss of a Local Edit when the user refreshes, closes, or navigates away from a Draft outside its explicit Exit. The Console does not install a browser-level unsaved-change warning because the Draft has no durable save or restoration path.
_Avoid_: browser-level draft confirmation, false recovery promise, persisted local edit

**Goal Contract Draft Validation Feedback**:
The pre-confirmation feedback for an invalid Goal Contract Draft. Confirmation validates every Contract field, keeps the Detail View expanded, focuses the first invalid field, and presents both that field's reason and an aggregate count of unresolved errors; invalid editing remains possible.
_Avoid_: silent rejected confirmation, summary-only error, locked invalid Draft

**Goal Contract Draft JSON Formatting**:
The user-triggered readability action for the Completion Criteria editor. Valid JSON may be rewritten with stable two-space indentation; invalid JSON remains unchanged and reports its parse location, while semantic fields are not repaired automatically.
_Avoid_: silent auto-fix, semantic normalization, criteria mutation by formatting

**Goal Contract Draft Character Boundary**:
The visible pre-confirmation character limit that matches the Goal Contract model: Objective and Autonomy Boundary each allow up to 4000 characters. The Completion Criteria editor is governed by its actual structured-field limits rather than a presentation-only short limit.
_Avoid_: mockup character limit, client-only truncation, inconsistent Contract validation

**Goal Contract Confirmation Handoff**:
The transient state after a valid Draft is submitted: the Draft becomes non-editable while its Goal is created, then the user receives confirmation that execution is starting before the existing Goal runtime surface takes over.
_Avoid_: editable submission, silent card disappearance, separate manual start step

**Goal Contract Confirmation Success State**:
The card-local success feedback in a Goal Contract Confirmation Handoff. It replaces the Draft actions briefly before the existing Goal runtime surface takes over and does not use a global notification.
_Avoid_: global confirmation toast, disappearing confirmation, manually dismissed success state

**Unconfirmed Goal Contract Draft Change**:
A Local Edit whose current Draft differs from its received proposal. Its Execution Summary reflects the changed values immediately and identifies the Draft as unconfirmed even when its Detail View is collapsed.
_Avoid_: stale summary, saved contract, hidden unconfirmed change

**Goal Contract Draft Change Equivalence**:
The normalization rule for determining whether a Draft has an Unconfirmed Change: Objective and Autonomy Boundary compare after trim, valid Completion Criteria JSON compares as structured content, and Constraint entries compare in their entered order after per-line trim. Reverting to an equivalent original Contract removes the change marker.
_Avoid_: formatting-only change, whitespace-only change, unordered constraint equivalence

**Goal Contract Draft Constraint Pair**:
The paired editable presentation of a Draft's `must_preserve` and `must_not_do` Constraint lists. The pair is displayed side by side when space permits and stacks on narrow screens without changing either list's independent meaning.
_Avoid_: merged constraint list, reordered constraint semantics, desktop-only layout

**Empty Goal Contract Draft Constraint**:
The visible optional state of either Constraint list in a Goal Contract Draft. The editable field remains available with an empty-state prompt, while the Execution Summary identifies the corresponding Constraint as not set.
_Avoid_: omitted constraint field, required empty constraint, hidden optional state

**Editable Goal Proposal**:
The pre-creation Goal-ready Proposal state in which the user may directly edit every Goal Contract Draft field: objective, Completion Criteria and their verification definitions, Constraints, and Autonomy Boundary. Edits are revalidated and reconfirmed as one proposal; they do not create a Goal until confirmation succeeds. The Initial Execution Plan remains private to the Main Agent.
_Avoid_: post-start Contract patch, implicit Contract revision, partial confirmation, read-only generated criterion

**Confirmed Goal Contract Boundary**:
The lifecycle boundary after which objective, Completion Criteria, Constraints, and Autonomy Boundary are editable only through Direct Goal Edit. A submitted direct edit creates a pending Goal Revision and becomes active at the next Goal Turn settlement boundary; direct editing is not available through ordinary Steering or Main Agent output.
_Avoid_: mutable active Contract, field-level silent rewrite, model-initiated revision

**Pending Goal Revision**:
The user-submitted Direct Goal Edit that has passed Contract validation but is waiting for the current Main Agent turn to settle. It does not alter the active Contract or current turn; at settlement the Goal Runtime atomically activates it, discards the old Revision's pending decision effects, and starts later execution from the new Contract.
_Avoid_: immediate in-turn rewrite, Main Agent revision proposal, partially active Contract

**Immediate Goal Revision Activation**:
The no-turn rule for Direct Goal Edit: when a Goal has no running Main Agent turn, a validated submitted edit activates its new Revision immediately. An edited `WAITING` Goal becomes `ACTIVE` and starts a new turn so old wait conditions cannot hold the new Contract; `PAUSED`, `BLOCKED`, `LIMITED`, and `INTERRUPTED` retain their state until explicit Resume. Only an edit submitted during a running turn remains Pending until the turn settlement boundary.
_Avoid_: waiting for nonexistent turn, stale waiting condition, edit-triggered non-waiting auto-resume, stale Revision resume

**Prior Revision SubAgent Run**:
A Goal-owned Background SubAgent Run launched under an earlier Goal Revision after a newer Revision becomes active. It is allowed to finish under existing lifecycle rules, but its result cannot automatically satisfy the newer Revision or produce its completion evidence; a Main Agent must explicitly reverify any reused result for the active Revision.
_Avoid_: forced edit cancellation, automatic cross-Revision evidence, stale completion result

**Prior Revision Verification Run**:
A Verification Run launched under an earlier Goal Revision after a newer Revision becomes active. It may naturally finish or receive its existing approval outcome, but its result is recorded only for the earlier Revision and cannot transition the active Revision to `COMPLETE`; the active Revision begins with every Completion Criterion unverified.
_Avoid_: cross-Revision completion, forced verification cancellation, inherited verification pass

**Goal Edit Validation Failure**:
The rejected Direct Goal Edit outcome when the submitted Contract fails field or deterministic-verification validation. The active Revision and lifecycle state remain unchanged; the Monitor receives field-level errors and no partial Revision is created or filled by the Main Agent.
_Avoid_: partial Contract activation, model auto-completion, invalid Revision

**Initial Execution Plan**:
The private first execution approach generated by the Main Agent after a Goal Contract is confirmed, such as first steps and next focus. It is never shown for user approval, may be replaced through replanning, and does not belong to the Goal Contract.
_Avoid_: user-approved plan, Goal objective, Completion Criterion, permanent plan

**Unified Goal Proposal Entry**:
The rule that explicit Goal Mode and Plan Mode both produce the same Goal-ready Proposal and use the same Goal Contract Confirmation Card. On confirmation, Plan Mode atomically exits and Goal Mode begins; Contract and verification semantics have no entry-specific variant.
_Avoid_: Plan-to-Goal field mapping, parallel proposal schema, implicit mode crossover

**Goal Contract Clarification**:
The use of the existing structured clarification interaction before a Goal-ready Proposal when objective, Completion Criteria, deterministic verification, Constraints, or Autonomy Boundary remain materially unresolved. No Goal is created until these points can form an editable, valid Goal Contract Draft.
_Avoid_: implicit Contract gap, premature Goal creation, unverified criterion

**Goal Monitor API**:
The read-only Goal snapshot endpoint plus independent pause, resume, cancel, and Direct Goal Edit action endpoints used by the Goal Monitor Entry. Contract mutation never uses ordinary text or a generic PATCH; it follows the direct-edit submission flow.
_Avoid_: mutable snapshot endpoint, text control API, Agent-proposed Contract patch

**Recent Goal Monitor Selection**:
The Chat-scoped selection rule that returns the most recently created Goal still in any non-terminal lifecycle state; when none exists, it returns the most recently created Goal in that Chat. A Chat may contain multiple sequential Goals, but the shortcut exposes only one.
_Avoid_: all-Goal dashboard, oldest active Goal, concurrent Goal chooser

**Sequential Chat Goals**:
The rule that one Chat may create multiple Goals only in order: a new Goal is allowed after the previous Goal reaches `COMPLETE` or `CANCELLED`; `PAUSED`, `BLOCKED`, `LIMITED`, and `Interrupted Goal` remain non-terminal and cannot be bypassed by starting or switching to another Goal.
_Avoid_: parallel Goals, suspended Goal switching, hidden Goal queue

**Goal Mode Release**:
The automatic return to ordinary Chat behavior when a Goal reaches `COMPLETE` or `CANCELLED`. Later user messages require a fresh Explicit Goal Mode Entry and a newly confirmed Goal Contract to create another Goal.
_Avoid_: sticky Goal mode, post-completion autonomous loop, implicit next Goal

**Goal Non-terminal Control Hold**:
The rule that `PAUSED`, `BLOCKED`, `LIMITED`, and `Interrupted Goal` retain the current Goal's control ownership and prevent a sequential Chat Goal from bypassing it. Explicit Resume continues the current Revision from its persisted state; `LIMITED` starts a new Goal Budget Cycle and `BLOCKED` preserves its failure count. Direct Goal Edit creates a newly confirmed Revision.
_Avoid_: non-terminal release, implicit retry, bypass Goal

**Completion Review Run**:
The Goal Runtime's independent Completion Judge evaluation after a Main Agent proposes completion. The Judge may use only first-phase read-only tools through the existing Tool Guard, path boundaries, and approval flow; its decisions, reasons, evidence references, and pending approval are persisted in the Goal Runtime Snapshot. If a tool needs approval, the Goal enters `WAITING` and approval resumes the same Run without consuming a Main Agent turn; denied approval is a Completion Review Rejection with its explicit reason.
_Avoid_: Main Agent self-test claim, unguarded host check, mutating completion check

**Mandatory Completion Set**:
The complete set of Completion Criteria in a first-phase Goal Contract. Every member must be accepted by Contract-bound Completion Review before the Goal Runtime can enter `COMPLETE`; the first phase has no optional criteria or partial-completion state.
_Avoid_: best-effort criterion, optional acceptance check, partial success

**Completion Review Evidence**:
The candidate evidence references considered by a Completion Review Run for one Completion Criterion in one Goal Revision, together with that Run's accepted decision. An accepted decision marks the criterion satisfied and resets its rejection counter; a new Revision does not inherit it as satisfied evidence.
_Avoid_: Main Agent claim, cross-Revision proof, permanently valid test result

**Incremental Goal Verification**:
The first-phase revalidation rule: after an environment-writing Main Agent turn, its Structured Goal Turn Resolution identifies the Completion Criteria affected by that change, and the Goal Runtime reruns only their Contract-bound Verification. Unaffected verified evidence remains valid within the same Goal Revision; `COMPLETE` still requires valid successful evidence for every Mandatory Completion Criterion.
_Avoid_: global verification invalidation, dependency graph, unchecked changed criterion

**Goal Continuation Context**:
The bounded, runtime-built input for the next Main Agent turn when a prior turn settles with `continue` or after a permitted Goal Wake Event. It carries the confirmed Contract and current Revision, pending Steering, verified and remaining Completion Criteria, relevant verification failures, and the next focus. Goal-owned Background SubAgent links are runtime-internal wake and lifecycle state; the Main Agent obtains all SubAgent information through its existing tools and its own conversation context rather than receiving it inline. It is not a full replay of the chat transcript.
_Avoid_: Agent self-recursion, full conversation replay, inline SubAgent state or result injection, free-form continuation guess

**Completion Proposal Turn**:
A Main Agent turn that proposes Goal completion and supplies evidence references, but does not itself finish the Goal Chat Stream. Its conclusion remains pending until the independent Verification Run passes every Mandatory Completion Criterion.
_Avoid_: final answer, Agent-declared completion, unverified success message

**Goal Finalization Turn**:
The final short, read-only and tool-free Main Agent turn started after every required Verification Run passes, or when a Goal request must close in a non-active state. It produces the formal Chat response and ends the Goal Chat Stream; it neither advances the Goal nor consumes the Goal Turn Budget.
_Avoid_: pre-verification final answer, Goal Runtime-authored delivery, budgeted execution turn, failed-verification completion

**Goal Finalization Candidate Assistant Response**:
The visible text produced by a **Goal Finalization Turn** for formal Chat delivery. It is one **Candidate Assistant Response** and is evaluated by the **Stop Hook** exactly once before the Goal Chat Stream closes; internal Goal turns are not Candidate Assistant Responses. A Stop block may request only a tool-free Finalization retry. Those retries consume the existing `max_stop_turns` limit in their own Finalization-local counter, never reopen Goal execution or verification, and never consume the Goal Turn Budget.
_Avoid_: per-turn Goal Stop, Goal Runtime status message, Goal-budgeted retry, execution-turn retry

**Assistant Response Text Projection**:
The ordered visible text extracted from a Candidate Assistant Response for a Stop Hook. It excludes reasoning and media content while allowing a message that also contains passive media to remain a Candidate Assistant Response.
_Avoid_: reasoning-inclusive response, media payload, pure-text-only message requirement

**Text-preserving Stop Transformation**:
A Stop output transformation that replaces only an **Assistant Response Text Projection** while preserving every non-text block of its Candidate Assistant Response. The complete replacement is written into the first `text` block, later `text` blocks are emptied, and non-text blocks retain their original content and order. The transformer cannot inspect, replace, suppress, or reorder reasoning or passive media content.
_Avoid_: media transformation, whole-message replacement, transformer-visible reasoning, inferred multi-block replacement mapping

**Finalization Fallback**:
The fixed minimal system response emitted when a Goal Finalization Turn cannot produce text because of a model or infrastructure failure. It is not a **Goal Finalization Candidate Assistant Response** and does not invoke a Stop Hook; the runtime records the gate skip as `finalization_fallback`, closes the current request without retrying or changing the persisted Goal state, and directs the user to the authoritative Goal Monitor Summary.
_Avoid_: fabricated Agent conclusion, fallback Stop transformation, finalization retry loop, implicit Goal transition

**Goal Mode Exclusivity**:
The Composer and runtime rule that Goal Mode cannot coexist with Plan Mode or Explicit Expert Selection. Entering Goal Mode clears those selections; a non-terminal Goal prevents switching to them until the Goal is released, while Goal-owned Background SubAgent delegation remains available under existing rules.
_Avoid_: expert-assisted Goal, Plan Goal overlap, mid-Goal identity switch

**Explicit Goal Mode Entry**:
The user's deliberate selection of Goal Mode in the Chat Composer before submitting a request. It authorizes Contract proposal and later confirmation, but a Main Agent in ordinary chat may only recommend Goal Mode and cannot create a Goal by itself.
_Avoid_: inferred Goal start, Agent-initiated autonomous run, normal chat continuation

**Goal Steering Queue**:
The ordered durable collection of ordinary user messages received while a Goal is `ACTIVE` or `WAITING`. They do not create parallel normal Agent requests; after the current turn settles, the next Goal Turn receives them as execution context in arrival order.
_Avoid_: concurrent chat request, immediate turn interruption, unordered prompt merge

**Goal-as-Chat Controller**:
The first-phase role of Goal Runtime as an invisible controller of one Chat request: it decides whether the Main Agent execution continues or the request ends, while the Chat UI continues to show only the existing Main Agent/tool process and final response. Goal lifecycle summaries and controls are exposed only through the Goal Monitor Entry.
_Avoid_: Goal chat message, Goal status transcript, separate Goal conversation

**Goal Chat Stream**:
The existing Chat request stream carrying Main Agent and tool events across automatic Goal turns. It has no Goal-specific timeline messages; it remains open through `ACTIVE` and `WAITING`, then ends after a Goal Finalization Turn when the current request is concluded.
_Avoid_: per-turn Goal message, hidden autonomous stream, premature response completion

**Waiting Goal Stream**:
The open Goal Chat Stream state while a Goal waits for a permitted Goal Wake Event. It emits no LLM status message; a wake event resumes the same in-request Goal Event Loop. If the transport disconnects first, the Goal becomes an Interrupted Goal rather than completing or cancelling.
_Avoid_: waiting poll output, synthetic assistant response, disconnect cancellation

**Goal Request Finalization**:
The end of the current Goal Chat Stream after a Goal Finalization Turn. `COMPLETE` and `CANCELLED` also release Goal Mode, while `PAUSED`, `BLOCKED`, and `LIMITED` remain non-terminal Goal states that retain control ownership and require a later explicit resume in a new sticky request.
_Avoid_: terminal-only stream closure, non-terminal Goal release, runtime-authored final reply

**Non-active Goal Request Closure**:
The first-phase connection rule that closes the current Chat request after Finalization when a Goal is `PAUSED`, `BLOCKED`, or `LIMITED`. `INTERRUPTED` instead loses its request with the owner instance and has no Finalization Turn. Only `ACTIVE` and `WAITING` retain the current request; explicit Resume starts a new sticky request for the same Goal.
_Avoid_: long-held paused connection, reconnect auto-resume, terminal-only closure, impossible crash finalization

**Internal Goal Turn Boundary**:
The intercepted normal-completion signal from a Main Agent turn while Goal Mode remains in control. The runtime settles the turn and may continue, wait, verify, or finalize without emitting a terminal Chat completion event; only the Goal Finalization Turn completes the frontend response stream.
_Avoid_: per-turn SSE completion, hidden loop recursion, duplicate assistant response

**安全策略最终一致窗口**:
安全策略写入共享配置文件后，各应用实例通过独立的文件轮询发现并加载新版本所允许的最长时间。本项目约定轮询周期为 30 秒；保存请求所在实例立即加载，其他实例最迟在下一次轮询时加载。轮询或加载失败时，实例继续使用最近一次成功加载的规则并静默重试。
_Avoid_: 瞬时全局生效、严格同步提交、失败时清空规则

**安全策略调用边界**:
Tool Guard 在一次工具调用开始后固定使用该调用已选定的规则快照；策略 reload 只影响之后开始的工具调用，不中断或重判正在执行的调用。
_Avoid_: 中途切换规则、强制终止工具调用、回溯重判

**配置原子写入**:
所有通过公共配置写入口保存的配置都以同目录临时文件完成写入后再原子替换目标文件，使读取方只能看到完整的旧版本或完整的新版本。
_Avoid_: 直接截断目标文件、读取半写入 JSON、仅安全策略专用的写入语义

**安全策略实例状态**:
每个应用实例仅在内存中维护其最近一次成功加载的安全策略文件指纹；该状态不对外暴露、不记录日志，不参与策略决策或跨实例协调。
_Avoid_: 以单实例状态宣称全局已生效、失败即覆盖有效规则、依赖中心化通知状态

**安全策略轮询周期**:
所有应用实例使用固定的 30 秒共享配置轮询周期，不通过环境变量或实例级配置覆盖，以保持各实例的一致传播上限。
_Avoid_: 实例间不同轮询周期、动态缩短或延长传播承诺、依赖外部调度器

**模型配置**:
绑定到一个具体可选模型的生成行为参数与能力边界，包括采样参数以及输入、输出长度限制。Provider 下的每个模型各自拥有模型配置；模型配置不同于 Provider 连接配置，并在切换激活模型时随模型生效。
_Avoid_: Provider 级默认参数、Agent Profile 模型配置、连接凭据

**模型输入长度限制**:
一个模型可接受的最大输入 token 数，也是该模型运行时的上下文预算。它优先于 Agent 级默认上下文预算；未设置时使用 Agent 级默认值。
_Avoid_: Provider API 的 `max_input_length` 请求参数、字符数限制、输出 token 上限

**模型输出长度限制**:
一个模型单次响应允许生成的最大输出 token 数，是每次模型调用的硬上限。它由 Provider 适配层转换为目标 API 的对应字段，不要求调用方感知 Provider 差异。
_Avoid_: 软提示长度、字符数限制、上下文总长度

**模型思考能力声明**:
模型配置中对 `enable_thinking` 与 `reasoning_effort` 的支持情况及当前选择的声明。它属于一个租户下的具体模型，并由聊天界面选择后用于实际模型调用。
_Avoid_: 用户级思考偏好、Provider 能力猜测、一次性请求参数

**思考强度支持列表**:
模型配置中声明该模型支持的 `reasoning_effort` 等级集合。空列表表示不支持该参数；非空列表同时表达支持能力与可选等级。
_Avoid_: 独立的 reasoning_effort 支持开关、运行时已选等级、Provider 全局等级

**思考开关支持声明**:
模型配置中的布尔能力声明，表示模型是否接受 `enable_thinking` 请求参数。仅声明支持时，聊天界面才展示会话思考开关。
_Avoid_: 默认启用思考、会话思考偏好、思考强度支持列表

**思考参数联动**:
只有当前模型的思考开关开启且其配置声明支持所选等级时，运行时请求才携带 `reasoning_effort`；关闭思考会清空并停止发送当前等级。
_Avoid_: 关闭思考仍发送强度、用户级固定强度、未声明等级透传

## Example Dialogue

Developer: "When Plan Mode starts, should we create a SubAgent?"

Domain Expert: "No. Plan Mode does not create a SubAgent by default; it is a special mode of the Main Agent. The Main Agent may still choose Plan Delegation explicitly when readonly delegation is available."

Developer: "Can the Main Agent decide to use Plan Mode by itself?"

Domain Expert: "It can suggest Plan Mode later, but this stage only enters Plan Mode after an Explicit Plan Entry."

Developer: "If the user enables the Plan Mode toggle, does it affect only the next message?"

Domain Expert: "No. It persists as the current Plan Mode State for that chat session until the user turns it off."

Developer: "Does Plan Mode freeze all writes until the user executes a plan?"

Domain Expert: "Yes. In Plan Mode, the Main Agent itself is permission-limited until planning is completed."

Developer: "Does executing a plan unlock write tools?"

Domain Expert: "`execute` accepts the persisted Proposed Plan and can move the chat back to normal execution, where the Main Agent regains its normal permissions."

Developer: "Is the hook attached to a SubAgent Definition or to an Agent Profile?"

Domain Expert: "It is an Agent Profile Hook. Its script belongs to that Agent Profile and is not a shared Skill asset."

Developer: "Can a tenant administrator replace the source's `read_file` implementation?"

Domain Expert: "No. Only a Source Tool Administrator may publish a Source Built-in Tool. An Override keeps `read_file`'s complete tool Schema, runs through the normal safety boundaries, and still respects each Agent's enabled or disabled choice."

Developer: "Will a new source tool appear only when the model asks for it?"

Domain Expert: "No. Every source-enabled tool that the Agent has not disabled is part of the Agent run's catalog from the start of that run."

Developer: "Can the `reviewer` agent in the security Skill collide with a `reviewer` in the Python Skill?"

Domain Expert: "No. The runtime exposes them as `security:reviewer` and `python:reviewer`; each qualified name belongs only to its Skill."

Developer: "Does every enabled Skill become available to `security:reviewer`?"

Domain Expert: "No. It receives only Skills and MCP clients named in its Definition Package. Missing or disabled dependencies are silently omitted."

Developer: "May the reviewer edit a file?"

Domain Expert: "Only when its inherited built-in tool set remains permitted by its allow/deny settings and by the parent Agent's Tool Guard and approval policy. A background run never waits for a new approval."

Developer: "What exactly does a shared Chat link expose?"

Domain Expert: "It exposes a Shared Conversation Snapshot made from at least one completed Shareable Answer Turn. The snapshot is fixed at creation, uses the ordinary Chat history redaction rules, and is rendered through a Read-only Share View."

Developer: "Can the owner revoke or expire the link?"

Domain Expert: "No. It is a Permanent Share Link: every generation creates a new opaque Share Token, and the link remains valid without time expiry or owner revocation."
